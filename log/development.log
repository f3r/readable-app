C-Fer engineers press a button to trigger a leak, letting diluted bitumen (one of the products pumping through the Keystone systems) or any other liquid hydrocarbon seep through specified ports.

[["author", "W. Wayt Gibbs"], ["content", "<div><span itemprop='articleBody' readability='64'><p/> <p>Illicit fishing goes on every day at an industrial scale. But large commercial fishers are about to get a new set of overseers: conservationists‚Äîand soon the general public‚Äîarmed with space-based reconnaissance of the global fleet.</p> <p>Crews on big fishing boats deploy an impressive arsenal of technology‚Äîfrom advanced sonars to GPS navigation and mapping systems‚Äîas they chase down prey and trawl the seabed. These tools are so effective that roughly a third of the world‚Äôs fisheries are now overharvested, and more than three-quarters of the stocks that remain have hit their sustainable limits, <a href='http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3822e.pdf'>according to the FAO</a>. For some species, most of the catch is unreported, unregulated, or flat-out illegal.</p> <p/>But now environmentalists are using sophisticated technology of their own to peel away that cloak of invisibility. With satellite data from <a href='http://www.spacequest.com/' target='_blank'>SpaceQuest</a> and financial and engineering support from Google, two environmental activist groups have built the first global surveillance system that can track large fishing vessels anywhere in the world. <p>A prototype of the system, called <a href='http://globalfishingwatch.org'>Global Fishing Watch</a>, was unveiled today at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney. The tool makes use of Google‚Äôs mapping software and servers to display the tracks followed in 2012 and 2013 by some 25,000 ships that were either registered as large commercial fishers or were moving in ways that strongly suggest fishing activity.</p> <p>The project was led by <a href='http://oceana.org/en' target='_blank'>Oceana</a>, a marine conservation advocacy group, and the software was developed by <a href='http://skytruth.org/' target='_blank'>SkyTruth</a>, a small non-profit that specializes in using remote sensing technologies to map environmentally sensitive activities such as <a href='http://blog.skytruth.org/2014/10/PA-drilling-impoundments-2005-2013.html'>fracking </a>and <a href='http://skytruth.org/mapping-global-flaring/'>flaring from oil and gas fields</a>. Although the system currently displays voyages from nearly a year ago, ‚Äúthe plan is that we will build out a public release version that will have near-real-time data,‚Äù said Jackie Savitz, Oceana‚Äôs VP for U.S. oceans. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll actually be able to see someone out there fishing within hours to days,‚Äù fast enough to act on the information if the fishing is happening illegally, such as in a marine protected area.</p> <p>The effort got its start at a conference in February, when Savitz sat down with Paul Woods of SkyTruth and Brian Sullivan of <a href='http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html' target='_blank'>Google‚Äôs Ocean and Earth Outreach program</a>, and the three discovered they had all been thinking along the same lines: that the pieces were in hand to put eyes on the global fishing fleet, or at least the bigger boats out there. SpaceQuest now has four satellites in orbit that continually pick up radio transmissions that large ships send out as part of their automatic identification system (AIS), broadcasts that include a unique ID number and the vessel‚Äôs current position, speed, and heading. Each packet of data is relatively small, but the total AIS data stream is massive because it captures all kinds of boats: naval warships, supertankers, barges, even some yachts. To AIS a boat is a boat; there‚Äôs no easy way to tell which ones are fishing.</p> <p>So the group turned to Analyze Corp., where data scientists teamed up with a former NOAA agent who worked for many years as an official fishery observer to develop a heuristic algorithm that synthesizes input such as rapid changes in trajectory, distances covered over the past 24 hours, long-term movements and port visits over months, and the self-declared identity and class of the boat. ‚ÄúIt combines all that and spits out a weighted classification‚Äîessentially a probability that this vessel is fishing at this particular spot and time,‚Äù Woods said.</p> <p>The filter isn‚Äôt perfect, but it winnows the data significantly. From a 1-terabyte starting set of 3.7 billion AIS messages intercepted from 111,000 vessels, the system extracted 300 million data points on about 25,000 boats that looked like they were fishing.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe were able to independently verify 3,125 of those as fishing vessels,‚Äù Woods said. He notes that the system does pick up some non-fishing activity as false positives.</p> <p>Arguably more important are the false negatives. Global Fishing Watch still misses most of the activity of the so-called dark fleet: smaller fishing boats that aren‚Äôt required to use AIS, and rogue fishers who turn their radios off before they enter restricted zones.</p> <p>‚ÄúThat is an issue, but the cool thing is the model can detect erratic AIS transmissions,‚Äù Savitz said. ‚ÄúIf we see pings from a vessel every hour for a month, then it goes silent, but suddenly comes back on weeks later, we can pick that up and possibly trigger enforcement against them for not transmitting as they are supposed to.‚Äù</p> <p>Perhaps equally important, ‚Äúwe think this could be a tool for positive reinforcement to reward good fishing behavior,‚Äù said Brian Sullivan, a program manager with Google‚Äôs Ocean and Earth Outreach program. ‚ÄúIf people can pay a premium for responsibly harvested fish with confidence in the supply chain, that aligns the economic incentives in a powerful way.‚Äù</p> <p>The next step is to open up use of the tool to everyone and plug it into a live stream of satellite data, so that ship tracks are current to within a few days. ‚ÄúThe product really is not very far away from being a public platform,‚Äù Woods said. ‚ÄúEverything works in a web browser and on Google servers in the cloud. We could launch something publicly in a couple months if we secure funding to pay for the data feed.‚Äù</p> <p>In the meantime, Oceana has begun using the tool internally to track vessels that have already been blacklisted for fishing illegally, Savitz said. ‚ÄúWe can see vessels that appear to be fishing in protected marine areas. Government officials often know about this activity but don‚Äôt do anything about it. We‚Äôll use the tool to shine light on this activity and produce public pressure for officials to actually do their jobs.‚Äù</p></span></div><br><br><center><a href='http://www.wizardrss.com'>Powered By WizardRSS.com</a> | <a href='http://www.wizardrss.com'>Full Text RSS Feed</a> | <a href='http://wpzonbuilder.com'>Amazon Wordpress</a> | <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Credit-Card-Rfid-Blocking-Wallet-Sleeves/dp/B00IXR4TR2/'>rfid blocking wallet sleeves</a></center>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-14 09:25:35.982784"], ["link_identifier", "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/40765c9e/sc/4/l/0L0Swired0N0C20A140C110Cplan0Emap0Eillegal0Efishing0Espace0C/story01.htm"], ["main_img_url", "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/skytruth-gfw-world_pacific-1920x1080-660x371.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-13"], ["title", "The Plan to Map Illegal Fishing From Space"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-14 09:25:35.982784"]]

Depending on where you stood, it was a struggle between the future and the past, the East Coast and the West Coast, culture and commerce, the masses and the elite, technologists and traditionalists, predator and prey.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='254' data-total-count='2336' itemprop='articleBody'>James Patterson was a forceful voice against Amazon during the dispute. ‚ÄúBooks and publishing need to be preserved if not protected in this country,‚Äù said Mr. Patterson, a best-selling Hachette novelist. ‚ÄúFor the moment, this deal helps do that.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='463' data-total-count='2799' itemprop='articleBody'>The multiyear agreement, which includes both e-books and print books, broadly follows a deal Amazon recently worked out with Simon &amp; Schuster. A source with knowledge of that deal said it was negotiated relatively quickly and gave the publisher control over most of its pricing but offered incentives to sell at lower prices. Amazon got increased co-op funds, the payments for placement on the retailer‚Äôs website. Simon &amp; Schuster declined to confirm the terms.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='131' data-total-count='2930' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-3'>James L. McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, said that if Hachette won in the short term, it would be a different story in the long run.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='394' data-total-count='3324' itemprop='articleBody'>‚ÄúHachette got Amazon to allow them to control pricing while also cutting the amount of money Amazon takes if the publisher does engage in discounts, which appears like a victory,‚Äù the analyst said. ‚ÄúBut in the end this all cements Amazon‚Äôs ultimate long-term role in this business, which will only put Hachette right back in this situation every time they are up for renegotiation.‚Äù </p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='86' data-total-count='3410' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-4'>Neither side gave many details of the deal, but both pronounced themselves satisfied.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='171' data-total-count='3581' itemprop='articleBody'>An Amazon executive, David Naggar, said Amazon was ‚Äúpleased with this new agreement as it includes specific financial incentives for Hachette to deliver lower prices.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='336' data-total-count='3917' itemprop='articleBody'>Amazon feels publishers get too much of the revenue from e-books, so that was another major area of contention. In a letter Thursday to authors and agents, Michael Pietsch, Hachette‚Äôs chief executive, said the percentage of revenue on which Hachette authors‚Äô e-book royalties are based ‚Äúwill not decrease under this agreement.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='41' data-total-count='3958' itemprop='articleBody'>The change for consumers might be slight.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='288' data-total-count='4246' itemprop='articleBody'>‚ÄúWhat does this mean for the publishing world? Not much,‚Äù J. A. Konrath, a fierce critic of traditional publishing houses, <a title='His blog.' href='http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/'>wrote on his blog</a>. The big New York publishers, he added, ‚Äúare no doubt going to continue to price e-books as high as they can to protect their paper sales.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='306' data-total-count='4552' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-5'>The deal will bring relief to Hachette‚Äôs bottom line. United States sales for the Hachette Book Group were down 18.5 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago, its parent company, Lagard√®re, <a title='The company&#x2019;s Q3 results (PDF).' href='http://www.lagardere.com/fichiers/fckeditor/File/Relations_investisseurs/Resultats_financiers/resultats_&amp;'>reported on Thursday</a>.

Among Amazon‚Äôs tactics was preventing advance sales, and causing weekslong shipping delays.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='187' data-total-count='5026' itemprop='articleBody'>Douglas Preston, a thriller writer published by Hachette, formed Authors United, a group with about 1,500 members, including some of the most prominent and popular writers in the country.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='229' data-total-count='5255' itemprop='articleBody'>‚ÄúI‚Äôm relieved that Amazon and Hachette reached an agreement,‚Äù Mr. Preston said. But he added: ‚ÄúIf anyone thinks this is over, they are deluding themselves. Amazon covets market share the way Napoleon coveted territory.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='234' data-total-count='5489' itemprop='articleBody'>Authors United and the Authors Guild, which has 9,000 members, are in the midst of writing a lengthy letter to the Justice Department urging an investigation of Amazon on antitrust grounds. Mr. Preston said that effort would continue.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='39' data-total-count='5528' itemprop='articleBody'>Hachette writers had varying responses.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='134' data-total-count='5662' itemprop='articleBody'>‚ÄúThank God,‚Äù Dave Cullen, the author of ‚ÄúColumbine,‚Äù wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúBut #EvilAmazon still a menace. Continue boycott.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='267' data-total-count='5929' itemprop='articleBody'>Meryl Gordon, author of ‚ÄúThe Phantom of Fifth Avenue,‚Äù said she was ‚Äúdelighted and relieved.‚Äù She added: ‚ÄúI hope that Amazon has learned that books are not commodities like dishwasher detergent.  I‚Äôm looking forward to buying books again on my Kindle.‚Äù</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='272' data-total-count='6201' itemprop='articleBody'>At least some Hachette books still showed shipping delays as of Thursday night. Several popular Malcolm Gladwell titles all showed delays of one to three weeks. Mr. Preston and Lincoln Child‚Äôs thriller ‚ÄúThe Lost Island‚Äù was described as taking as long as four weeks.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='350' data-total-count='6551' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-7'>Mr. Preston, who proved quite a thorn in Amazon‚Äôs side, said the retailer and publisher were at odds until the last minute. He wrote in an email that his new novel with Mr. Child, ‚ÄúBlue Labyrinth,‚Äù was released this week but that some buyers found it impossible to download the e-book version on Amazon. Buyers lashed out with one-star reviews.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='152' data-total-count='6703' itemprop='articleBody'>‚ÄúWhen customers complained Amazon sent them a note saying it was Hachette‚Äôs fault,‚Äù Mr. Preston wrote. Other Hachette books had similar troubles.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='134' data-total-count='6837' itemprop='articleBody'>Was this a digital hiccup, or a final reminder by Amazon of its power?

In Mong Kok, the site of most of these attacks, demonstrators set up an area for female protesters to practice self defense.</p>\n<figure id=\"image-285912\" class=\"inline-image  aligncenter zoomable size-medium\"><div class=\"inline-image-tools\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"share-button\" data-image-id=\"285912\">Share</a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"share-icons desaturated\">\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F285345%2Fthe-umbrella-movement-marks-a-coming-of-age-for-hong-kongs-princess-generation%2Fi%2F285912%2F&amp;text=The+Umbrella+Movement+marks+a+coming+of+age+for+Hong+Kong%26%238217%3Bs+%26%238220%3Bprincess%26%238221%3B+generation&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-twitter\"></a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F285345%2Fthe-umbrella-movement-marks-a-coming-of-age-for-hong-kongs-princess-generation%2Fi%2F285912%2F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-facebook\"></a>\n</div>\n<span class=\"help-text\"><i class=\"icon-zoom\"></i>Tap image to zoom</span>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/strong-women-corner.jpg?w=640\" data-retina=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/10/strong-women-corner.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"In Mong Kok, protesters set up a small ‚ÄúGirls pump up area.‚Äù\"><figcaption class=\"inline-image-caption\">In Mong Kok, protesters set up a small ‚ÄúGirls pump up area.‚Äù<span class=\"inline-image-credit\">(Cheng Sealing)</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>For women of older generations, these protests signal¬†progress.

Earlier this week Bloomberg (kudos to them) <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-11/will-ferrell-s-funny-or-die-said-to-consider-sale.html\" target=\"_blank\">also reported</a> that Funny or Die, the website co-founded in 2007 by Will Ferrell, was¬†working with the investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to evaluate strategic options, including a possible sale.</p>\n<p>Here is a killer quote from an internal memo Bloomberg obtained that was circulated to staff by Funny or Die‚Äôs CEO Dick Glover.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are NOT trying to sell Funny or Die, but we thought it wise to engage some experts to help us evaluate the situation. In the meantime, if any of you mistakenly receive a briefcase full of cash, please bring it to my office immediately.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So why is now such a great time to try sell or raise funds for a comedy business? Put simply, as Bill Gates said nearly two decades ago, content is king. In a¬†digital age where the rise of mobile devices and social media is causing audience fragmentation, almost every established media and technology company is trying to figure out how to capture eyeballs‚Äîand both of these companies do that.</p>\n<p>Funny or Die is basically a digital video business distributed through social media, a dream combination for many established players. For example,¬†<span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Disney </span><a style=\"line-height:1.5;\" href=\"http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/bob-iger-explains-why-disney-bought-maker-studios-1201173389/\" target=\"_blank\">bought Maker Studios</a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">, a creator of content on YouTube channels, for $500 million earlier this year; while Vice Media raised $250 million from cable channel A&amp;E at a </span><a style=\"line-height:1.5;\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/29/us-a-e-vicemedia-idUSKBN0GT2G320140829\" target=\"_blank\">$2.5 billion valuation</a><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\"> in September. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.5;\">Time Warner was an early backer of Funny or Die and through subsidiaries, holds about a 17% stake in the business, according to the<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/funny-or-die-inc-explores-sale-1415760787\" target=\"_blank\"> Wall Street Journal</a>¬† (paywall).</span></p>\n<p>The Onion expanded into video production years ago and, like Funny or Die, has a strong presence on YouTube. The satirical outlet began life as a print publication, but <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/08/news/la-sh-the-onion-cuts-print-publication-20131108\" target=\"_blank\">ceased print</a> editions last year, to focus on <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/03/onion-turns-25/2910381/\" target=\"_blank\">digital publishing</a>. There is currently strong investor appetite for exposure to this dynamic, too. Buzzfeed, the enormously successful viral content¬†company¬†<a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/\" target=\"_blank\">secured financing</a> from one of Silicon Valley‚Äôs most respected venture capital funds, Andressen Horowitz, at a valuation of $850 million last US summer.</p>\n<p>In fact, one of the Onion‚Äôs publications, Clickhole, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/06/clickhole_the_onion_s_new_site_is_more_than_a_buzzfeed_parody.html\" target=\"_blank\">directly satirizes Buzzfeed</a>. Its owners will probably be hoping that the imitation is not limited to content, but also to finances.</p>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"share-buttons colored\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul data-author=\"John McDuling\" data-title=\"The Onion and Funny or Die are both up for sale.

Really expensive.</p>\n<p>The latest report¬†by real estate agent¬†<a href=\"http://blog.coldwellbanker.com/latest-home-listing-report-ranks-expensive-affordable-cities-buy-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Coldwell Banker</a> on prices of family homes¬†found across the US found, for the second time in three years, that the average house in Los Altos, California, is the priciest in the country, at nearly $2 million.</p>\n<p>Coldwell Banker‚Äôs annual report compares four-bedroom, two-bathroom homes of a similar size across¬†nearly 2,000 cities. Property markets in and around Silicon Valley are prominent at the¬†top of the rankings, a <a href=\"http://www.citylab.com/housing/2014/11/buy-one-home-in-silicon-valleyor-30-in-cleveland/382624/\" target=\"_blank\">source of angst</a> for residents¬†priced out of the tech cluster.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-ad\"></div>\n<p>For the same price as a place in Los Altos, a buyer could¬†get no fewer¬†than 30 homes in Cleveland, the cheapest market tracked by Coldwell Banker‚Äîa different one for just about every day of the month. (Quartz did <a href=\"http://qz.com/286239/heres-how-many-houses-you-can-buy-in-other-cities-for-the-price-of-one-in-silicon-valley/\" target=\"_blank\">some similar calculations</a>¬†last month, with equally eye-opening results.)</p>\n<p>Few will argue that Silicon Valley‚Äôs property market is anything but frothy, but¬†affordability is in the eye of the beholder. The average household in Los Altos makes more than $235,000 a year, according to the latest Census Bureau figures. Although the typical four-bedroom house in the city is more than eight times larger, the gap is even bigger as you travel closer to San Francisco (including within the city itself) and down the coast to areas like Santa Barbara, near¬†Los Angeles:</p>\n<figure id=\"image-296236\" class=\"inline-image  alignnone zoomable size-medium\"><div class=\"inline-image-tools\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"share-button\" data-image-id=\"296236\">Share</a>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"share-icons desaturated\">\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F294056%2Fanother-way-to-look-at-americas-least-affordable-housing-markets%2Fi%2F296236%2F&amp;text=Another+way+to+look+at+America%26%238217%3Bs+least+affordable+housing+markets&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-twitter\"></a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F294056%2Fanother-way-to-look-at-americas-least-affordable-housing-markets%2Fi%2F296236%2F\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"icon-facebook\"></a>\n</div>\n<span class=\"help-text\"><i class=\"icon-zoom\"></i>Tap image to zoom</span>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/average-four-bedroom-two-bathroom-home-25-most-expensive-price-price-to-income-ratio_chartbuilder.png?w=640\" data-retina=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/11/average-four-bedroom-two-bathroom-home-25-most-expensive-price-price-to-income-ratio_chartbuilder.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"></figure><p class=\"p1\">By contrast, in the well-to-do Chicago suburb of Winnetka and hedge fund-heavy enclaves of Greenwich and Westport, Connecticut, near-million dollar homes are only around three-to-four¬†times the average family‚Äôs income.

If something bad happens, it‚Äôs because someone‚Äôs an idiot or I didn‚Äôt get the resources or the market moved. ‚Ä¶ What we‚Äôve seen is that the people who are the most successful here, who we want to hire, will have a fierce position. They‚Äôll argue like hell. They‚Äôll be zealots about their point of view. But then you say, ‚Äòhere‚Äôs a new fact,‚Äô and they‚Äôll go, ‚ÄòOh, well, that changes things; you‚Äôre right.‚Äô‚Äù</p></blockquote>\n<h2>People that make it without college are often the most exceptional</h2>\n<p>Talent exists in so many places that hiring managers who rely on a few schools are using it as a crutch and missing out. Bock says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWhen you look at people who don‚Äôt go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings. And we should do everything we can to find those people.‚Äù</p></blockquote>\n<p>Many schools don‚Äôt deliver on what they promise, Bock says, but generate a ton of debt in return for not learning what‚Äôs most useful.¬†It‚Äôs an ‚Äúextended adolescence,‚Äù he says.</p>\n<h2><strong>Learning ability is more important than IQ</strong></h2>\n<p>Succeeding in academia isn‚Äôt always a sign of being able to do a job. Bock <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html?pagewanted=2\" target=\"_blank\">has previously said</a> that college can be an ‚Äúartificial environment‚Äù that conditions for one type of thinking. IQ is less valuable than learning on the fly, <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html?_r=0&amp;referrer=\" target=\"_blank\">Bock says:</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>‚ÄúFor every job, though, the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it‚Äôs not IQ. It‚Äôs learning ability. It‚Äôs the ability to process on the fly. It‚Äôs the ability to pull together disparate bits of information. We assess that using structured behavioral interviews that we validate to make sure they‚Äôre predictive.‚Äù</p></blockquote>\n<p>A behavioral interview, in contrast with those that ask people to figure out how many tennis balls fit into a tennis court, might ask how you‚Äôve reacted to a particularly difficult problem in the past. They can also help find people who fit the company‚Äôs definition of leadership. It‚Äôs not about leading a club at school or an impressive prior title, Bock says, but the ability to step up and lead when it‚Äôs necessary.</p>\n<h3>Read This Next:¬†<a href=\"http://qz.com/177694/why-major-creative-breakthroughs-happen-in-your-late-thirties/\">Why major creative breakthroughs happen in your late thirties¬†</a><a href=\"http://qz.com/177694/why-major-creative-breakthroughs-happen-in-your-late-thirties/\"><br>\n</a>\n</h3>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"article-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"share-buttons colored\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul data-author=\"Max Nisen\" data-title=\"Why Google doesn‚Äôt care about hiring top college graduates\" data-on=\"\">\t\t\n\t<li class=\"twitter\">\n\t\t<a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Why%20Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20care%20about%20hiring%20top%20college%20graduates&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F180247&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\t</li>\n\t<li class=\"facebook\">\n\t\t<a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F180247\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\t</li>\n\t<li class=\"linkedin\">\n\t\t<a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F180247&amp;title=Why%20Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20care%20about%20hiring%20top%20college%20graduates&amp;summary=Google%20has%20spent%20years%20analyzing%20who%20succeeds%20at%20the%20company%2C%20which%20has%20moved%20away%20from%20a%20focus%20on%20GPAs%2C%20brand%20name%20schools%2C%20and%20interview%20brain%20teasers.%C2%A0%C2%A0%20In%20a%20conversation%20with%20The%20New%20York%20Times%26%238217%3B%C2%A0Tom%20Friedman%2C%20Google%26%238217%3Bs%20head%20of%20people%20operations%2C%20Laszlo%20Bock%2C%20detailed%20what%20the%20company%20looks%20for.%20And%20increasingly%2C%20it%26%238217%3Bs%20not%20about%20credentials.%20Graduates%20%5B%26hellip%3B%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\t</li>\n\t<li class=\"email\">\n\t\t<a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20Why%20Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20care%20about%20hiring%20top%20college%20graduates&amp;body=http://qz.com/180247%0A%0AGoogle%20has%20spent%20years%20analyzing%20who%20succeeds%20at%20the%20company%2C%20which%20has%20moved%20away%20from%20a%20focus%20on%20GPAs%2C%20brand%20name%20schools%2C%20and%20interview%20brain%20teasers.%C2%A0%C2%A0%20In%20a%20conversation%20with%20The%20New%20York%20Times%E2%80%99%C2%A0Tom%20Friedman%2C%20Google%E2%80%99s%20head%20of%20people%20operations%2C%20Laszlo%20Bock%2C%20detailed%20what%20the%20company%20looks%20for.%20And%20increasingly%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20not%20about%20credentials.%20Graduates%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\t</li>\n\t<li class=\"whatsapp\">\n\t\t<a title=\"WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=Why%20Google%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20care%20about%20hiring%20top%20college%20graduates:http%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2F180247\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"short-url\">\n\t\t\t\t<label>Share this:</label><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/180247\">\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n"], ["created_at", "2014-11-15 11:53:14.093268"], ["link_identifier", "http://qz.com/180247"], ["main_img_url", "http://img.qz.com/2014/02/rtr3acyo.jpg?w=940, http://img.qz.com/2014/02/rtr3acyo.jpg?w=1880 2x"], ["pub_date", "2014-02-24"], ["title", "Why Google doesn‚Äôt care about hiring top college graduates"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-15 11:53:14.093268"]]

One piece, which resembled a water pump or a large diving bell, was so big and heavy he couldn‚Äôt move it. There was also a metal box with a scratched-away label that he couldn‚Äôt read, and a cylinder about 3 feet long, which Sanchez thought he could use to split firewood.</p>\n<p>The other farmers hadn‚Äôt yet arrived, so he grabbed the cylinder with both hands and heaved it over his shoulder, carrying it a few yards over to the corn husks that had been piled in the field to dry. He was sure no one would find it in there.</p>\n<p>Sanchez hadn‚Äôt yet heard the news, but these were parts of a radiation therapy device that Mexico‚Äôs Social Security Institute was replacing throughout state hospitals, stolen from a truck the day before. Even though the machine was considered obsolete as a medical device, it contained 3,000 curies of cobalt-60, a Category 1 (the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/source-reduction-management/sources.html\">most dangerous</a> classification) synthetic radioactive isotope ‚Äî more than enough to kill anyone exposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255733\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 153px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255733','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Pemex in Tepojaco where the robbery occurred. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The hijacking had taken place 12 miles away in Tepojaco, a town popular with truckers traveling in and out of Mexico City. The driver was en route from a public hospital in Tijuana to a nearby disposal site for hazardous waste and had pulled off the highway to sleep in an unlit spot across from a Pemex gas station. At around 1 a.m., he heard a tap on the window and saw two men with guns standing outside. They forced their way into the cab and bound the driver‚Äôs hands.</p>\n<p>The driver‚Äôs partner was in the back and heard the noise of the driver being tied up. He managed to slip away without notice. Security footage revealed little else; the robbery had taken place in the middle of the night. Armando Ramos, a federal agent who responded to the scene, told me that the truck, a white 2007 Volvo, could be made out pulling into a spot directly behind another truck, which obscured it from view. Soon the truck pulled away; the culprits were never seen. There was also no way to guess where the truck had gone.</p>\n<p>The hazardous materials were being transported without security, and though the truck was, according to some early reports, outfitted with GPS, it hadn‚Äôt been turned on ‚Äî which looked suspect. Initially, said Ramos, ‚Äúwe assumed the driver had something to do with it.‚Äù According to one <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzUmf_KoMSAC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=cargo+thefts+mexico+10,000+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsadHeg-Js&amp;sig=ulai6GvErenk8MqhJJU6YcCXLPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryRlVP_GLqbgsAS654LIBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cargo%20thefts%20mexico%2010%2C000%20year&amp;f=false\">study</a>, 10,000 highway cargo thefts occurred per year between 2006 and 2010, a rate of 27 per day, and the highest concentration is in the towns encircling Mexico City ‚Äî and <i>autorobo</i>, when companies are in on the robberies to take a cut as well as collect insurance, is also commonplace.</p>\n<p>That theory was ruled out against the more mundane reality that the hijackers didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd taken. Instead, the thieves had followed a standard script: Rather than hurting the driver, they simply let him out down the road, alive, and continued on, another night‚Äôs work. They would have known that no one was watching them and believed they would not be caught. Victims of crimes often don‚Äôt bother reporting them to police, who aren‚Äôt likely to solve them, and who may have a stake themselves. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/020/2014/en/468aee5a-ecc3-470f-9387-a8a10b5670cc/amr410202014en.pdf\">According to Amnesty International</a>, complaints of civil rights violations at the hands of authorities have increased 600% between 2003 and 2013.</p>\n<p>But this robbery broke through, ascending to an increasingly rare category in Mexico: that of a notorious, headline-making crime. The hijackers who thought they were pulling off another score instead had pulled off the most brazen theft of radioactive materials in memory. Twenty-four hours later, the world knew what they‚Äôd done.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. networks devoted coverage to the missing ‚Äúingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb,‚Äù in the words of one headline. The White House said it was ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the situation. Juan Eibenschutz, the director of Mexico‚Äôs National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, who‚Äôd flown straight home from Paris to handle the crisis, made a public plea: ‚ÄúIf anyone finds a big chunk of metal with radiation symbols all over it they should notify us immediately.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the world of nuclear safety, stories of mishaps and misidentification abound. The <a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">most infamous case</a> involves a Brazilian man who was so mesmerized by the cesium-137 capsule that turned up in his junkyard that he opened it up and passed out the contents to neighbors, who rubbed it on their skin. Even in Mexico this had happened before: A source of cobalt-60 was melted into rebar that became dining table legs bound for the U.S. market; they weren‚Äôt discovered until a delivery truck took a wrong turn in the vicinity of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered alarms.</p>\n<p>But this was a theft, not an accident, perpetrated in the midst of a vast economy thriving on the traffic of illicit, dangerous things. What if the cobalt-60 was removed from its protective encasement, sold, and harnessed for a dirty bomb ‚Äî an apocalyptic twist straight out of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>? Mexican officials privately believed that a terrorist plot was as unlikely as the Doomsday Machine. But as long as the cobalt-60 was missing, the possibility couldn‚Äôt be dismissed. The International Atomic Energy Agency deemed the teletherapy machine ‚Äúextremely dangerous.‚Äù Eibenschutz added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost absolutely certain that whoever removed this material by hand is either dead or about to die.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared as the latest crisis on the evening news, the cobalt-60 was safely recovered and the story vanished. A year ‚Äî and zero known radiation-related fatalities ‚Äî later, it‚Äôs still not clear who was behind the theft. And whether that‚Äôs a cause for relief or a cause for greater worry is up for debate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255338\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"908\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 860px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255338','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Adam Setala for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Removed from the country, it‚Äôs easy to think of Mexico as suffering from a single form of cartel-related bloodshed. But up close, a more insidious form of violence has crept in. Criminal organizations once devoted to trafficking drugs have diversified widely: A single recent operation against La Familia Michoacana, a militant group with a mythically devout ethos, revealed that the group had sold 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore in China for $42 million. In 2012, Mexico estimated that in lost wages, foreign investments, and public health bills, crime at large had siphoned $16.5 billion, or 1.3%, from the GDP. Overall killings are down, but in a recent <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/mexico-crime-survey-reveals-conflicting-trends\">self-reported survey</a>, kidnapping and extortion were up. And everyday crimes are the ones that pull at the social fabric, making life and labor miserable. Perhaps most instructive of all: The perception of violence has risen. More Mexicans feel less safe.</p>\n<p>President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto recently attempted to address the problem by unveiling a special economic crimes task force composed of fresh-faced officers who, as a selling point, had never before worked for the police. Though, as one analyst told the Associated Press in a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mexico-creates-special-economic-crime-force-0\">report</a> about the new gendarmerie, ‚ÄúWe have been creating new police forces for decades ‚Äî armored police, ‚Äòincorruptible, super-trained police.‚Äô‚Äù But to little effect.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the December hijacking, little focus went to the thieves or the farmers who found the cobalt. The five men arrested allegedly belonged to a truck theft gang centered in Zumpango, a commuter town on the Mexico state‚ÄìHidalgo border, booked within days of the robbery. Local police had rounded up the suspects and handed them over to federal agents. The Mexican government often trumpets its marquee arrests, but the attorney general‚Äôs office couldn‚Äôt even dig up a press release when I called. And so, along with the culprits, the other issues surrounding the hijacking that had roused public attention ‚Äî the fact that government contractors were transporting lethal radioactive waste through gang-rife territory without security or even GPS ‚Äî were soon forgotten. People were understandably less interested in some common thieves than the specter of a dirty bomb. There‚Äôd been no media parades showcasing the suspects, no presidential tweets, only a quiet booking. The men were shipped off to a federal prison in Tamaulipas to await judgment.</p>\n<p>Five months after the hijacking, I flew to Mexico City. I hired a driver, Marco Callejas, to get around the towns outside the capital, and he picked me up in front of a Starbucks on a sunny morning last May. Marco wore a sporty uniform of track pants, sneakers, and wraparound sunglasses like the kind off-duty police officers wear. His car was an old maroon Tsuru, Mexico‚Äôs ubiquitous Nissan Sentra. The taxi company had randomly assigned him, so when Marco said he‚Äôd grown up near Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state, which forms a triangle with Tepojaco, where the cobalt-60 was stolen, and the cornfield in Hueypoxtla where it was found, it felt comforting, like good luck. Marco patted the front seat, the only one besides his with a belt. ‚ÄúCome on up!‚Äù he said. I climbed in.</p>\n<p>As Marco and I drove out of Mexico City, I asked if he remembered the hijacking. ‚ÄúGosh, it would be so easy to cross something like that over the border.‚Äù Marco shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing the Mexicans and the Arabs aren‚Äôt friends!‚Äù</p>\n<p>We took a road veering off the highway and drove for a long time on dirt roads, passing through small towns. The countryside looked like an old Western stage setting with cacti and mountains in the distance, except for the billboards advertising a hotline for kidnapping victims and the highway sign riddled with bullet holes. None of the addresses we plugged into the GPS seemed to work. So we stopped a man on a horse for directions.</p>\n<p>In Zumpango, we pulled up to the scrapyard belonging to one of the alleged thieves, Luis Angel Torres. His father, also named Luis, was standing in front talking to a customer with his arms crossed over a black T-shirt that read ‚ÄúThe Queen of Convenience Stores Works Here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He led us through the scrapyard‚Äôs receiving garage, which opened up to a large sorting area where workers were crushing metal into perfectly compressed squares. According to the family, Luis Angel was accused of, among other things, dismantling the stolen truck, crushing it to pieces, and selling it off. (Luis Angel is facing charges relating to organized crime and abandonment of radioactive materials, according to the family‚Äôs attorney; repeated requests for information about the hijacking from state and federal officials were denied or ignored.) The office was painted bright lavender and had a large shrine to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Torres made himself comfortable. He put his feet up on the desk, over a collage of family photos overlaid with plastic. Torres said he was a family man. Scrap metal was all his boy had ever known, he said.</p>\n<p>Luis Angel, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, was the youngest of Torres‚Äô five children, a father of three, and the fourth generation to work in <i>chatarro</i>, a business his great grandfather had started out of a pushcart. Now the Torres empire extended to four or five scrapyards. Three months before his arrest, Luis Angel had opened his own.</p>\n<p>The way Torres told the story, on the afternoon following the hijacking, Miguel, a childhood friend of Luis Angel, showed up at Luis Angel‚Äôs new shop with a large wooden crate for sale. ‚ÄúThere was nothing on the outside marking it,‚Äù Torres said. The next day, Luis Angel‚Äôs 16-year-old part-time employee Andres opened the crate and began to unpack the contents. Dust poured out of the box, and he peered inside, noticing a small radiation symbol. Luis Angel and Andres suddenly felt a wave of nausea ‚Äî an early sign of radiation poisoning ‚Äî and rushed to a local clinic.</p>\n<p>As Torres was talking, his daughter wandered into the room. She was also dressed in black. She waved a hand over her soiled shirt and said something about ‚Äúgetting our hands dirty.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Torres continued. Returning from the clinic that night, Luis Angel was frightened. News of the missing materials was making rounds on the radio and on the evening news, and he would have known what he‚Äôd purchased by then. He and Andres loaded up an old Dodge truck and headed out of town. After a while on the dark road, skirting the main highways, the field in Hueypoxtla must have seemed desolate enough.</p>\n<p>Dumping the material was Luis Angel‚Äôs mistake, Torres said, not stealing it. ‚ÄúWe say we‚Äôre innocent. But who‚Äôs going to listen to us?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The following afternoon two men arrived at Andres‚Äô house claiming to have been sent from the public health administration. Upstairs they found Andres, Luis Angel, and a cousin of Luis Angel. In fact they were ministerial police. They had received a tip from the clinic about two men exhibiting signs of radiation poisoning. All three were taken into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4256414\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"874\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 826px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4256414','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis whole story about a dirty bomb is a bunch of fantasies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in Mexico City, I had gone to see Juan Eibenschutz at his office in the center of the city.

He talked about the way this gang or that gang operated, and pointed out landmarks. ‚ÄúThere used to be a lot of assaults here. Truckers would pull onto these dirt roads, and a lot of women were raped,‚Äù he said one afternoon as we passed an empty street. He seemed to enjoy being an investigator. He asked a lot of questions, and offered theories of his own. It occurred to me that Marco might have worked in law enforcement. But when I asked, he said, ‚ÄúNo way. Mexican cops are symbols of corruption and mediocrity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Francisco Sanchez lived outside Hueypoxtla on communal farming land. When we pulled into his driveway, he was outside in the shade of a giant flowering prickly pear cactus, the plant that jutted out of the earth everywhere. Sanchez‚Äôs house, like all the houses there, was a hodgepodge of brick, stone, mud, and corrugated tin. The indoor space blended into the outdoors. Hueypoxtla is a windy, dry place, but it‚Äôs never too cold, and the climate is good for growing crops like barley and alfalfa. Marco pointed out that the maguey plant grows wild there. The maguey is the plant used to make <i>pulque</i>, the ancient Aztec spirit, which, also according to Marco, the poorest residents of the region sometimes feed to their children when there‚Äôs nothing else to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255746\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"360\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 312px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255746','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That afternoon, Sanchez pointed to his perch under the prickly pears and disappeared into the house, re-emerging with the boxes of the medications he has had to take since he got sick and pictures of his radiation burns that his wife, Yolanda, who was washing dishes in their outdoor sink, had snapped in the hospital. Sanchez had been hospitalized for six weeks with radiation poisoning and still wasn‚Äôt able to expose his skin to sunlight for very long. He was only 41 but looked like an old man, sun-weathered.</p>\n<p>He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and had a large bandage covering his left shoulder and another taped over his hand. Radiation sickness can be fatal, but Sanchez said he‚Äôd had on a thick jacket that morning and had only carried the cylinder a few meters. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, then slowly peeled the bandage to reveal skin that was still seared and pink. Normally, he said, he would have been out in the fields preparing for the summer rains, but he hadn‚Äôt worked since that morning in December.

The biggest piece couldn‚Äôt be lifted with a wheelbarrow or a tractor. But they estimated that the metal was worth $400. It was enough to cover the family‚Äôs expenses for two weeks. Moya hurried back up the hill for his truck. He hooked chains around the shield and dragged it up the road to his property, kicking up a trail of shimmering dust. With the shield safely on his lot, the ecstatic Moya family took turns posing for photos, squatting down beside it, making peace signs, sitting on it, laughing. The celebration didn‚Äôt last long. Someone from the community had already called the police.</p>\n<p>The Moya family soon began to think of their discovery as a curse. Three weeks later, the son-in-law, Juan Antonio Saldivar was arrested in a separate incident for stealing a cement truck. The attorney his family hired told me that the arrest glared with irregularities, chief among them the fact that it preceded the actual crime by half an hour. Officers rifling through his phone saw the photos of the shield and, in an apparent attempt to bolster their profile of Saldivar as a seasoned hijacker, stated in charging documents that he had been ‚Äúdetained‚Äù by authorities ‚Äúin relation to the cobalt-60 theft.‚Äù Authorities questioned his family after the cobalt was recovered at their home but didn‚Äôt arrest them. Saldivar has now been in jail for 11 months and is facing a sentence of 16 years for the cement truck theft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255519\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 726px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255519','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Later that day, as we were getting ready to leave Hueypoxtla, Marco pulled up a photograph on his phone of him in a federal police uniform. ‚ÄúI was a federal police officer for 10 years,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>I stared at the image.

The realization dawned that I‚Äôd hired a stranger who might or might not be a crooked ex-policeman to ferry me around the hijacking epicenter of Mexico in search of bandits with possible connections to organized crime or even terrorists and that I was now stuck alone with him in the country. But I wanted to go back to Zumpango to find Andres. Marco knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>I had already gone by the place a couple of times. The story that Torres had told me implicated police officers in a corruption scheme and painted his son as an innocent man. But when I‚Äôd asked to see the truck that Luis Angel had used, he said the family had sold it. There was a third employee in the shop with him that day, but he had disappeared. Miguel was also nowhere to be found. Other details didn‚Äôt add up. Andres had been released by authorities on account of his age.</p>\n<p>At Andres‚Äô house, salsa was blaring and a big red truck was parked inside the gate. A tiny old woman in an apron answered the door. She said no one was home.</p>\n<p>Down the street from the house, I had seen four men drinking cans of Modelo under an awning. ‚ÄúThe truck was right there,‚Äù said one, pointing to a spot down the street, in front of Luis Angel‚Äôs shop, the one that had been raided by police. Torres had told me police had taped it off and the family was stuck paying the rent, but it looked open; a couple of cars were parked inside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy was the truck sitting outside?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were too many trucks in the shop already!‚Äù said another. They all laughed and continued dishing about the Torres family. According to them, Luis Angel had a chop shop. One of Luis Angel‚Äôs co-defendants, a man Torres had told me was a new acquaintance, in fact worked with him, they said, painting the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI live across the street and sometimes there were so many trucks in there they had to park them outside,‚Äù said one of the men.</p>\n<p>What about Miguel? I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one Miguel in this town,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe went to the United States 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The woman from Andres‚Äô house walked down the street toward us.

The place had a disorienting bleached-out quality, like a condensed version of the Inland Empire, and his office was in a row house that looked exactly like all the others on his street.</p>\n<p>Cesar swung open the door. He was short and round, like an egg. He had on a pink shirt, a pink tie, a blue sweater-vest, and blue slacks ‚Äî Danny DeVito and Mr. Rogers at the same time. His partner, a pretty blonde with big brown eyes in a brown pantsuit, descended the stairs. Cesar invited me to have a seat on a brown-and-white leather sectional. I stared down at a zebra-print rug and, to my right, a pair of electric guitars upright in stands, at the ready.</p>\n<p>I had hoped Cesar would give me a copy of the police report and charging documents. Such things can be tough to come by in Mexico, even after a case is closed. The files would clarify the questions I had about the Torres family‚Äôs story and the official versions that police had furnished to local press.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Cesar began. ‚ÄúDo you know how justice works in Mexico?‚Äù My heart sank as he went on. ‚ÄúIf the courts find out that you‚Äôre interviewing witnesses ‚Äî believe me, apart from affecting the defense, there‚Äôs juridical revenge. You start seeing stuff in the newspapers, on the radio, on TV. It just gets very complicated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He stood up. ‚ÄúWhat this case needs right now is for things to cool down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He showed me the door.</p>\n<p>Back home, I followed up with him for a while, but the answer was always the same: He needed more time.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Marco, who had added me on Facebook, posted the photo he‚Äôd shown me in the car of himself in uniform. The comments suggested that Marco‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt know he had ever been a police officer. ‚ÄúWhat clothesline line‚Äôd ya steal that uniform from?‚Äù read one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not from a clothesline. It‚Äôs rented!‚Äù</p>\n<p>I thought back to going to a federal police campus in Mexico City, where Marco told me he‚Äôd been ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù by one of the officers, who observed the particular way he jumped out of a van. A normal person ‚Äî me ‚Äî would exit facing forward. But Marco climbed out sideways, a reflex, he explained, from all his years carrying a long firearm. They‚Äôd spotted him and knew he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Had Marco invented that story? Was he not a police officer accused of corruption? I thought it over for a couple of days. But I decided it was better not to ask him. I didn‚Äôt think I would get a straight answer.</p>\n<p>On June 8, another source of radioactive material was stolen from a warehouse near Zumpango. This time it was a source that authorities considered less dangerous than the cobalt from the December heist. Police weren‚Äôt able to track it, but 10 days later it turned up in a garbage bag by a sewage canal. A security guard who spotted it believed the bag contained a body.

One piece, which resembled a water pump or a large diving bell, was so big and heavy he couldn‚Äôt move it. There was also a metal box with a scratched-away label that he couldn‚Äôt read, and a cylinder about 3 feet long, which Sanchez thought he could use to split firewood.</p>\n<p>The other farmers hadn‚Äôt yet arrived, so he grabbed the cylinder with both hands and heaved it over his shoulder, carrying it a few yards over to the corn husks that had been piled in the field to dry. He was sure no one would find it in there.</p>\n<p>Sanchez hadn‚Äôt yet heard the news, but these were parts of a radiation therapy device that Mexico‚Äôs Social Security Institute was replacing throughout state hospitals, stolen from a truck the day before. Even though the machine was considered obsolete as a medical device, it contained 3,000 curies of cobalt-60, a Category 1 (the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/source-reduction-management/sources.html\">most dangerous</a> classification) synthetic radioactive isotope ‚Äî more than enough to kill anyone exposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255733\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 153px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255733','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Pemex in Tepojaco where the robbery occurred. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The hijacking had taken place 12 miles away in Tepojaco, a town popular with truckers traveling in and out of Mexico City. The driver was en route from a public hospital in Tijuana to a nearby disposal site for hazardous waste and had pulled off the highway to sleep in an unlit spot across from a Pemex gas station. At around 1 a.m., he heard a tap on the window and saw two men with guns standing outside. They forced their way into the cab and bound the driver‚Äôs hands.</p>\n<p>The driver‚Äôs partner was in the back and heard the noise of the driver being tied up. He managed to slip away without notice. Security footage revealed little else; the robbery had taken place in the middle of the night. Armando Ramos, a federal agent who responded to the scene, told me that the truck, a white 2007 Volvo, could be made out pulling into a spot directly behind another truck, which obscured it from view. Soon the truck pulled away; the culprits were never seen. There was also no way to guess where the truck had gone.</p>\n<p>The hazardous materials were being transported without security, and though the truck was, according to some early reports, outfitted with GPS, it hadn‚Äôt been turned on ‚Äî which looked suspect. Initially, said Ramos, ‚Äúwe assumed the driver had something to do with it.‚Äù According to one <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzUmf_KoMSAC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=cargo+thefts+mexico+10,000+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsadHeg-Js&amp;sig=ulai6GvErenk8MqhJJU6YcCXLPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryRlVP_GLqbgsAS654LIBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cargo%20thefts%20mexico%2010%2C000%20year&amp;f=false\">study</a>, 10,000 highway cargo thefts occurred per year between 2006 and 2010, a rate of 27 per day, and the highest concentration is in the towns encircling Mexico City ‚Äî and <i>autorobo</i>, when companies are in on the robberies to take a cut as well as collect insurance, is also commonplace.</p>\n<p>That theory was ruled out against the more mundane reality that the hijackers didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd taken. Instead, the thieves had followed a standard script: Rather than hurting the driver, they simply let him out down the road, alive, and continued on, another night‚Äôs work. They would have known that no one was watching them and believed they would not be caught. Victims of crimes often don‚Äôt bother reporting them to police, who aren‚Äôt likely to solve them, and who may have a stake themselves. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/020/2014/en/468aee5a-ecc3-470f-9387-a8a10b5670cc/amr410202014en.pdf\">According to Amnesty International</a>, complaints of civil rights violations at the hands of authorities have increased 600% between 2003 and 2013.</p>\n<p>But this robbery broke through, ascending to an increasingly rare category in Mexico: that of a notorious, headline-making crime. The hijackers who thought they were pulling off another score instead had pulled off the most brazen theft of radioactive materials in memory. Twenty-four hours later, the world knew what they‚Äôd done.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. networks devoted coverage to the missing ‚Äúingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb,‚Äù in the words of one headline. The White House said it was ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the situation. Juan Eibenschutz, the director of Mexico‚Äôs National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, who‚Äôd flown straight home from Paris to handle the crisis, made a public plea: ‚ÄúIf anyone finds a big chunk of metal with radiation symbols all over it they should notify us immediately.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the world of nuclear safety, stories of mishaps and misidentification abound. The <a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">most infamous case</a> involves a Brazilian man who was so mesmerized by the cesium-137 capsule that turned up in his junkyard that he opened it up and passed out the contents to neighbors, who rubbed it on their skin. Even in Mexico this had happened before: A source of cobalt-60 was melted into rebar that became dining table legs bound for the U.S. market; they weren‚Äôt discovered until a delivery truck took a wrong turn in the vicinity of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered alarms.</p>\n<p>But this was a theft, not an accident, perpetrated in the midst of a vast economy thriving on the traffic of illicit, dangerous things. What if the cobalt-60 was removed from its protective encasement, sold, and harnessed for a dirty bomb ‚Äî an apocalyptic twist straight out of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>? Mexican officials privately believed that a terrorist plot was as unlikely as the Doomsday Machine. But as long as the cobalt-60 was missing, the possibility couldn‚Äôt be dismissed.

But up close, a more insidious form of violence has crept in. Criminal organizations once devoted to trafficking drugs have diversified widely: A single recent operation against La Familia Michoacana, a militant group with a mythically devout ethos, revealed that the group had sold 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore in China for $42 million. In 2012, Mexico estimated that in lost wages, foreign investments, and public health bills, crime at large had siphoned $16.5 billion, or 1.3%, from the GDP. Overall killings are down, but in a recent <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/mexico-crime-survey-reveals-conflicting-trends\">self-reported survey</a>, kidnapping and extortion were up. And everyday crimes are the ones that pull at the social fabric, making life and labor miserable. Perhaps most instructive of all: The perception of violence has risen. More Mexicans feel less safe.</p>\n<p>President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto recently attempted to address the problem by unveiling a special economic crimes task force composed of fresh-faced officers who, as a selling point, had never before worked for the police. Though, as one analyst told the Associated Press in a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mexico-creates-special-economic-crime-force-0\">report</a> about the new gendarmerie, ‚ÄúWe have been creating new police forces for decades ‚Äî armored police, ‚Äòincorruptible, super-trained police.‚Äô‚Äù But to little effect.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the December hijacking, little focus went to the thieves or the farmers who found the cobalt. The five men arrested allegedly belonged to a truck theft gang centered in Zumpango, a commuter town on the Mexico state‚ÄìHidalgo border, booked within days of the robbery. Local police had rounded up the suspects and handed them over to federal agents. The Mexican government often trumpets its marquee arrests, but the attorney general‚Äôs office couldn‚Äôt even dig up a press release when I called. And so, along with the culprits, the other issues surrounding the hijacking that had roused public attention ‚Äî the fact that government contractors were transporting lethal radioactive waste through gang-rife territory without security or even GPS ‚Äî were soon forgotten. People were understandably less interested in some common thieves than the specter of a dirty bomb. There‚Äôd been no media parades showcasing the suspects, no presidential tweets, only a quiet booking. The men were shipped off to a federal prison in Tamaulipas to await judgment.</p>\n<p>Five months after the hijacking, I flew to Mexico City. I hired a driver, Marco Callejas, to get around the towns outside the capital, and he picked me up in front of a Starbucks on a sunny morning last May. Marco wore a sporty uniform of track pants, sneakers, and wraparound sunglasses like the kind off-duty police officers wear. His car was an old maroon Tsuru, Mexico‚Äôs ubiquitous Nissan Sentra. The taxi company had randomly assigned him, so when Marco said he‚Äôd grown up near Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state, which forms a triangle with Tepojaco, where the cobalt-60 was stolen, and the cornfield in Hueypoxtla where it was found, it felt comforting, like good luck. Marco patted the front seat, the only one besides his with a belt. ‚ÄúCome on up!‚Äù he said. I climbed in.</p>\n<p>As Marco and I drove out of Mexico City, I asked if he remembered the hijacking. ‚ÄúGosh, it would be so easy to cross something like that over the border.‚Äù Marco shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing the Mexicans and the Arabs aren‚Äôt friends!‚Äù</p>\n<p>We took a road veering off the highway and drove for a long time on dirt roads, passing through small towns. The countryside looked like an old Western stage setting with cacti and mountains in the distance, except for the billboards advertising a hotline for kidnapping victims and the highway sign riddled with bullet holes. None of the addresses we plugged into the GPS seemed to work. So we stopped a man on a horse for directions.</p>\n<p>In Zumpango, we pulled up to the scrapyard belonging to one of the alleged thieves, Luis Angel Torres. His father, also named Luis, was standing in front talking to a customer with his arms crossed over a black T-shirt that read ‚ÄúThe Queen of Convenience Stores Works Here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He led us through the scrapyard‚Äôs receiving garage, which opened up to a large sorting area where workers were crushing metal into perfectly compressed squares. According to the family, Luis Angel was accused of, among other things, dismantling the stolen truck, crushing it to pieces, and selling it off. (Luis Angel is facing charges relating to organized crime and abandonment of radioactive materials, according to the family‚Äôs attorney; repeated requests for information about the hijacking from state and federal officials were denied or ignored.) The office was painted bright lavender and had a large shrine to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Torres made himself comfortable. He put his feet up on the desk, over a collage of family photos overlaid with plastic. Torres said he was a family man. Scrap metal was all his boy had ever known, he said.</p>\n<p>Luis Angel, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, was the youngest of Torres‚Äô five children, a father of three, and the fourth generation to work in <i>chatarro</i>, a business his great grandfather had started out of a pushcart. Now the Torres empire extended to four or five scrapyards. Three months before his arrest, Luis Angel had opened his own.</p>\n<p>The way Torres told the story, on the afternoon following the hijacking, Miguel, a childhood friend of Luis Angel, showed up at Luis Angel‚Äôs new shop with a large wooden crate for sale. ‚ÄúThere was nothing on the outside marking it,‚Äù Torres said. The next day, Luis Angel‚Äôs 16-year-old part-time employee Andres opened the crate and began to unpack the contents. Dust poured out of the box, and he peered inside, noticing a small radiation symbol. Luis Angel and Andres suddenly felt a wave of nausea ‚Äî an early sign of radiation poisoning ‚Äî and rushed to a local clinic.</p>\n<p>As Torres was talking, his daughter wandered into the room. She was also dressed in black. She waved a hand over her soiled shirt and said something about ‚Äúgetting our hands dirty.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Torres continued. Returning from the clinic that night, Luis Angel was frightened. News of the missing materials was making rounds on the radio and on the evening news, and he would have known what he‚Äôd purchased by then. He and Andres loaded up an old Dodge truck and headed out of town. After a while on the dark road, skirting the main highways, the field in Hueypoxtla must have seemed desolate enough.</p>\n<p>Dumping the material was Luis Angel‚Äôs mistake, Torres said, not stealing it. ‚ÄúWe say we‚Äôre innocent. But who‚Äôs going to listen to us?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The following afternoon two men arrived at Andres‚Äô house claiming to have been sent from the public health administration. Upstairs they found Andres, Luis Angel, and a cousin of Luis Angel. In fact they were ministerial police. They had received a tip from the clinic about two men exhibiting signs of radiation poisoning. All three were taken into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4256414\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"874\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 826px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4256414','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis whole story about a dirty bomb is a bunch of fantasies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in Mexico City, I had gone to see Juan Eibenschutz at his office in the center of the city.

He talked about the way this gang or that gang operated, and pointed out landmarks. ‚ÄúThere used to be a lot of assaults here. Truckers would pull onto these dirt roads, and a lot of women were raped,‚Äù he said one afternoon as we passed an empty street. He seemed to enjoy being an investigator. He asked a lot of questions, and offered theories of his own. It occurred to me that Marco might have worked in law enforcement. But when I asked, he said, ‚ÄúNo way. Mexican cops are symbols of corruption and mediocrity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Francisco Sanchez lived outside Hueypoxtla on communal farming land. When we pulled into his driveway, he was outside in the shade of a giant flowering prickly pear cactus, the plant that jutted out of the earth everywhere. Sanchez‚Äôs house, like all the houses there, was a hodgepodge of brick, stone, mud, and corrugated tin. The indoor space blended into the outdoors. Hueypoxtla is a windy, dry place, but it‚Äôs never too cold, and the climate is good for growing crops like barley and alfalfa. Marco pointed out that the maguey plant grows wild there. The maguey is the plant used to make <i>pulque</i>, the ancient Aztec spirit, which, also according to Marco, the poorest residents of the region sometimes feed to their children when there‚Äôs nothing else to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255746\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"360\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 312px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255746','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That afternoon, Sanchez pointed to his perch under the prickly pears and disappeared into the house, re-emerging with the boxes of the medications he has had to take since he got sick and pictures of his radiation burns that his wife, Yolanda, who was washing dishes in their outdoor sink, had snapped in the hospital. Sanchez had been hospitalized for six weeks with radiation poisoning and still wasn‚Äôt able to expose his skin to sunlight for very long. He was only 41 but looked like an old man, sun-weathered.</p>\n<p>He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and had a large bandage covering his left shoulder and another taped over his hand. Radiation sickness can be fatal, but Sanchez said he‚Äôd had on a thick jacket that morning and had only carried the cylinder a few meters. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, then slowly peeled the bandage to reveal skin that was still seared and pink. Normally, he said, he would have been out in the fields preparing for the summer rains, but he hadn‚Äôt worked since that morning in December. As we were talking, his 9-month-old son wheeled by on a mobile high chair.</p>\n<p>The cornfield was only a couple of kilometers away down the slope of a dusty road, just past the Marie Curie kindergarten. ‚ÄúCrazy about that name, right?‚Äù I said, as we passed the school, to silence.</p>\n<p>I had noticed empty canals lining the fields, and Sanchez explained that effluent from Mexico City was pumped out there, which the farmers use to irrigate their crops. I imagined the wastewater-fed crops being sold back to the capital and being consumed and then surging back through the pipes to Hueypoxtla like some giant closed-loop digestive tract.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255712\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 282px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255712','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>We reached the field.

He straightened his back and swept his arm, motioning to the emptiness. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone leave this here?‚Äù</p>\n<p>After he hid the cylinder, Sanchez had felt ill and experienced what he called ‚Äúa tremendous vomit,‚Äù but he hadn‚Äôt made the connection, so he went back to work, and he didn‚Äôt tell anyone what he‚Äôd found.

The biggest piece, the shield, was too heavy, and night fell with the pieces as Sanchez had found them.</p>\n<p>For the first week, Sanchez had been afraid to talk about what was happening to him, even as 100 Marines, federal agents, and local police cordoned off the field and <a href=\"http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/10/cobalt-60-still-sitting-in-mexican-cornfield/\">dispatched a robot</a> to retrieve the cobalt. He watched the evening news, clutching his son tightly, and asked Yolanda to rub ointment on his shoulder. Finally he let on to a friend. ‚ÄúI was dying of panic,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúPeople ask why I waited so long, but what they don‚Äôt understand is that I was totally blocked.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255756\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 177px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255756','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>A neighbor, Mauro Moya, a truck driver, took a walk to the field with his son and son-in-law and circled the objects like the farmers had done the day before, measuring and weighing them with their eyes. The biggest piece couldn‚Äôt be lifted with a wheelbarrow or a tractor. But they estimated that the metal was worth $400. It was enough to cover the family‚Äôs expenses for two weeks. Moya hurried back up the hill for his truck. He hooked chains around the shield and dragged it up the road to his property, kicking up a trail of shimmering dust. With the shield safely on his lot, the ecstatic Moya family took turns posing for photos, squatting down beside it, making peace signs, sitting on it, laughing. The celebration didn‚Äôt last long. Someone from the community had already called the police.</p>\n<p>The Moya family soon began to think of their discovery as a curse. Three weeks later, the son-in-law, Juan Antonio Saldivar was arrested in a separate incident for stealing a cement truck. The attorney his family hired told me that the arrest glared with irregularities, chief among them the fact that it preceded the actual crime by half an hour. Officers rifling through his phone saw the photos of the shield and, in an apparent attempt to bolster their profile of Saldivar as a seasoned hijacker, stated in charging documents that he had been ‚Äúdetained‚Äù by authorities ‚Äúin relation to the cobalt-60 theft.‚Äù Authorities questioned his family after the cobalt was recovered at their home but didn‚Äôt arrest them. Saldivar has now been in jail for 11 months and is facing a sentence of 16 years for the cement truck theft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255519\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 726px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255519','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Later that day, as we were getting ready to leave Hueypoxtla, Marco pulled up a photograph on his phone of him in a federal police uniform. ‚ÄúI was a federal police officer for 10 years,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>I stared at the image.

But I couldn‚Äôt absorb any of it. The realization dawned that I‚Äôd hired a stranger who might or might not be a crooked ex-policeman to ferry me around the hijacking epicenter of Mexico in search of bandits with possible connections to organized crime or even terrorists and that I was now stuck alone with him in the country. But I wanted to go back to Zumpango to find Andres. Marco knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>I had already gone by the place a couple of times. The story that Torres had told me implicated police officers in a corruption scheme and painted his son as an innocent man. But when I‚Äôd asked to see the truck that Luis Angel had used, he said the family had sold it. There was a third employee in the shop with him that day, but he had disappeared. Miguel was also nowhere to be found. Other details didn‚Äôt add up. Andres had been released by authorities on account of his age.</p>\n<p>At Andres‚Äô house, salsa was blaring and a big red truck was parked inside the gate. A tiny old woman in an apron answered the door. She said no one was home.</p>\n<p>Down the street from the house, I had seen four men drinking cans of Modelo under an awning. ‚ÄúThe truck was right there,‚Äù said one, pointing to a spot down the street, in front of Luis Angel‚Äôs shop, the one that had been raided by police. Torres had told me police had taped it off and the family was stuck paying the rent, but it looked open; a couple of cars were parked inside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy was the truck sitting outside?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were too many trucks in the shop already!‚Äù said another. They all laughed and continued dishing about the Torres family. According to them, Luis Angel had a chop shop. One of Luis Angel‚Äôs co-defendants, a man Torres had told me was a new acquaintance, in fact worked with him, they said, painting the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI live across the street and sometimes there were so many trucks in there they had to park them outside,‚Äù said one of the men.</p>\n<p>What about Miguel? I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one Miguel in this town,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe went to the United States 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The woman from Andres‚Äô house walked down the street toward us.

The place had a disorienting bleached-out quality, like a condensed version of the Inland Empire, and his office was in a row house that looked exactly like all the others on his street.</p>\n<p>Cesar swung open the door. He was short and round, like an egg. He had on a pink shirt, a pink tie, a blue sweater-vest, and blue slacks ‚Äî Danny DeVito and Mr. Rogers at the same time. His partner, a pretty blonde with big brown eyes in a brown pantsuit, descended the stairs. Cesar invited me to have a seat on a brown-and-white leather sectional. I stared down at a zebra-print rug and, to my right, a pair of electric guitars upright in stands, at the ready.</p>\n<p>I had hoped Cesar would give me a copy of the police report and charging documents. Such things can be tough to come by in Mexico, even after a case is closed. The files would clarify the questions I had about the Torres family‚Äôs story and the official versions that police had furnished to local press.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Cesar began. ‚ÄúDo you know how justice works in Mexico?‚Äù My heart sank as he went on. ‚ÄúIf the courts find out that you‚Äôre interviewing witnesses ‚Äî believe me, apart from affecting the defense, there‚Äôs juridical revenge. You start seeing stuff in the newspapers, on the radio, on TV. It just gets very complicated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He stood up. ‚ÄúWhat this case needs right now is for things to cool down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He showed me the door.</p>\n<p>Back home, I followed up with him for a while, but the answer was always the same: He needed more time.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Marco, who had added me on Facebook, posted the photo he‚Äôd shown me in the car of himself in uniform. The comments suggested that Marco‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt know he had ever been a police officer. ‚ÄúWhat clothesline line‚Äôd ya steal that uniform from?‚Äù read one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not from a clothesline. It‚Äôs rented!‚Äù</p>\n<p>I thought back to going to a federal police campus in Mexico City, where Marco told me he‚Äôd been ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù by one of the officers, who observed the particular way he jumped out of a van. A normal person ‚Äî me ‚Äî would exit facing forward. But Marco climbed out sideways, a reflex, he explained, from all his years carrying a long firearm. They‚Äôd spotted him and knew he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Had Marco invented that story? Was he not a police officer accused of corruption? I thought it over for a couple of days. But I decided it was better not to ask him. I didn‚Äôt think I would get a straight answer.</p>\n<p>On June 8, another source of radioactive material was stolen from a warehouse near Zumpango. This time it was a source that authorities considered less dangerous than the cobalt from the December heist. Police weren‚Äôt able to track it, but 10 days later it turned up in a garbage bag by a sewage canal. A security guard who spotted it believed the bag contained a body. Reports said it had sat by the canal untouched for several days, free for anyone to haul away.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255809\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"623\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 575px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255809','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4254612\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

One piece, which resembled a water pump or a large diving bell, was so big and heavy he couldn‚Äôt move it. There was also a metal box with a scratched-away label that he couldn‚Äôt read, and a cylinder about 3 feet long, which Sanchez thought he could use to split firewood.</p>\n<p>The other farmers hadn‚Äôt yet arrived, so he grabbed the cylinder with both hands and heaved it over his shoulder, carrying it a few yards over to the corn husks that had been piled in the field to dry. He was sure no one would find it in there.</p>\n<p>Sanchez hadn‚Äôt yet heard the news, but these were parts of a radiation therapy device that Mexico‚Äôs Social Security Institute was replacing throughout state hospitals, stolen from a truck the day before. Even though the machine was considered obsolete as a medical device, it contained 3,000 curies of cobalt-60, a Category 1 (the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/source-reduction-management/sources.html\">most dangerous</a> classification) synthetic radioactive isotope ‚Äî more than enough to kill anyone exposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"10\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255733\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 217px; top: 153px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255733','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Pemex in Tepojaco where the robbery occurred. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The hijacking had taken place 12 miles away in Tepojaco, a town popular with truckers traveling in and out of Mexico City. The driver was en route from a public hospital in Tijuana to a nearby disposal site for hazardous waste and had pulled off the highway to sleep in an unlit spot across from a Pemex gas station. At around 1 a.m., he heard a tap on the window and saw two men with guns standing outside. They forced their way into the cab and bound the driver‚Äôs hands.</p>\n<p>The driver‚Äôs partner was in the back and heard the noise of the driver being tied up. He managed to slip away without notice. Security footage revealed little else; the robbery had taken place in the middle of the night. Armando Ramos, a federal agent who responded to the scene, told me that the truck, a white 2007 Volvo, could be made out pulling into a spot directly behind another truck, which obscured it from view. Soon the truck pulled away; the culprits were never seen. There was also no way to guess where the truck had gone.</p>\n<p>The hazardous materials were being transported without security, and though the truck was, according to some early reports, outfitted with GPS, it hadn‚Äôt been turned on ‚Äî which looked suspect. Initially, said Ramos, ‚Äúwe assumed the driver had something to do with it.‚Äù According to one <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzUmf_KoMSAC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=cargo+thefts+mexico+10,000+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsadHeg-Js&amp;sig=ulai6GvErenk8MqhJJU6YcCXLPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryRlVP_GLqbgsAS654LIBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cargo%20thefts%20mexico%2010%2C000%20year&amp;f=false\">study</a>, 10,000 highway cargo thefts occurred per year between 2006 and 2010, a rate of 27 per day, and the highest concentration is in the towns encircling Mexico City ‚Äî and <i>autorobo</i>, when companies are in on the robberies to take a cut as well as collect insurance, is also commonplace.</p>\n<p>That theory was ruled out against the more mundane reality that the hijackers didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd taken. Instead, the thieves had followed a standard script: Rather than hurting the driver, they simply let him out down the road, alive, and continued on, another night‚Äôs work. They would have known that no one was watching them and believed they would not be caught. Victims of crimes often don‚Äôt bother reporting them to police, who aren‚Äôt likely to solve them, and who may have a stake themselves. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/020/2014/en/468aee5a-ecc3-470f-9387-a8a10b5670cc/amr410202014en.pdf\">According to Amnesty International</a>, complaints of civil rights violations at the hands of authorities have increased 600% between 2003 and 2013.</p>\n<p>But this robbery broke through, ascending to an increasingly rare category in Mexico: that of a notorious, headline-making crime. The hijackers who thought they were pulling off another score instead had pulled off the most brazen theft of radioactive materials in memory. Twenty-four hours later, the world knew what they‚Äôd done.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. networks devoted coverage to the missing ‚Äúingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb,‚Äù in the words of one headline. The White House said it was ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the situation. Juan Eibenschutz, the director of Mexico‚Äôs National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, who‚Äôd flown straight home from Paris to handle the crisis, made a public plea: ‚ÄúIf anyone finds a big chunk of metal with radiation symbols all over it they should notify us immediately.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the world of nuclear safety, stories of mishaps and misidentification abound. The <a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">most infamous case</a> involves a Brazilian man who was so mesmerized by the cesium-137 capsule that turned up in his junkyard that he opened it up and passed out the contents to neighbors, who rubbed it on their skin. Even in Mexico this had happened before: A source of cobalt-60 was melted into rebar that became dining table legs bound for the U.S. market; they weren‚Äôt discovered until a delivery truck took a wrong turn in the vicinity of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered alarms.</p>\n<p>But this was a theft, not an accident, perpetrated in the midst of a vast economy thriving on the traffic of illicit, dangerous things. What if the cobalt-60 was removed from its protective encasement, sold, and harnessed for a dirty bomb ‚Äî an apocalyptic twist straight out of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>? Mexican officials privately believed that a terrorist plot was as unlikely as the Doomsday Machine. But as long as the cobalt-60 was missing, the possibility couldn‚Äôt be dismissed.

But up close, a more insidious form of violence has crept in. Criminal organizations once devoted to trafficking drugs have diversified widely: A single recent operation against La Familia Michoacana, a militant group with a mythically devout ethos, revealed that the group had sold 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore in China for $42 million. In 2012, Mexico estimated that in lost wages, foreign investments, and public health bills, crime at large had siphoned $16.5 billion, or 1.3%, from the GDP. Overall killings are down, but in a recent <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/mexico-crime-survey-reveals-conflicting-trends\">self-reported survey</a>, kidnapping and extortion were up. And everyday crimes are the ones that pull at the social fabric, making life and labor miserable. Perhaps most instructive of all: The perception of violence has risen. More Mexicans feel less safe.</p>\n<p>President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto recently attempted to address the problem by unveiling a special economic crimes task force composed of fresh-faced officers who, as a selling point, had never before worked for the police. Though, as one analyst told the Associated Press in a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mexico-creates-special-economic-crime-force-0\">report</a> about the new gendarmerie, ‚ÄúWe have been creating new police forces for decades ‚Äî armored police, ‚Äòincorruptible, super-trained police.‚Äô‚Äù But to little effect.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the December hijacking, little focus went to the thieves or the farmers who found the cobalt. The five men arrested allegedly belonged to a truck theft gang centered in Zumpango, a commuter town on the Mexico state‚ÄìHidalgo border, booked within days of the robbery. Local police had rounded up the suspects and handed them over to federal agents. The Mexican government often trumpets its marquee arrests, but the attorney general‚Äôs office couldn‚Äôt even dig up a press release when I called. And so, along with the culprits, the other issues surrounding the hijacking that had roused public attention ‚Äî the fact that government contractors were transporting lethal radioactive waste through gang-rife territory without security or even GPS ‚Äî were soon forgotten. People were understandably less interested in some common thieves than the specter of a dirty bomb. There‚Äôd been no media parades showcasing the suspects, no presidential tweets, only a quiet booking. The men were shipped off to a federal prison in Tamaulipas to await judgment.</p>\n<p>Five months after the hijacking, I flew to Mexico City. I hired a driver, Marco Callejas, to get around the towns outside the capital, and he picked me up in front of a Starbucks on a sunny morning last May. Marco wore a sporty uniform of track pants, sneakers, and wraparound sunglasses like the kind off-duty police officers wear. His car was an old maroon Tsuru, Mexico‚Äôs ubiquitous Nissan Sentra. The taxi company had randomly assigned him, so when Marco said he‚Äôd grown up near Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state, which forms a triangle with Tepojaco, where the cobalt-60 was stolen, and the cornfield in Hueypoxtla where it was found, it felt comforting, like good luck. Marco patted the front seat, the only one besides his with a belt. ‚ÄúCome on up!‚Äù he said. I climbed in.</p>\n<p>As Marco and I drove out of Mexico City, I asked if he remembered the hijacking. ‚ÄúGosh, it would be so easy to cross something like that over the border.‚Äù Marco shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing the Mexicans and the Arabs aren‚Äôt friends!‚Äù</p>\n<p>We took a road veering off the highway and drove for a long time on dirt roads, passing through small towns. The countryside looked like an old Western stage setting with cacti and mountains in the distance, except for the billboards advertising a hotline for kidnapping victims and the highway sign riddled with bullet holes. None of the addresses we plugged into the GPS seemed to work. So we stopped a man on a horse for directions.</p>\n<p>In Zumpango, we pulled up to the scrapyard belonging to one of the alleged thieves, Luis Angel Torres. His father, also named Luis, was standing in front talking to a customer with his arms crossed over a black T-shirt that read ‚ÄúThe Queen of Convenience Stores Works Here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He led us through the scrapyard‚Äôs receiving garage, which opened up to a large sorting area where workers were crushing metal into perfectly compressed squares. According to the family, Luis Angel was accused of, among other things, dismantling the stolen truck, crushing it to pieces, and selling it off. (Luis Angel is facing charges relating to organized crime and abandonment of radioactive materials, according to the family‚Äôs attorney; repeated requests for information about the hijacking from state and federal officials were denied or ignored.) The office was painted bright lavender and had a large shrine to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Torres made himself comfortable. He put his feet up on the desk, over a collage of family photos overlaid with plastic. Torres said he was a family man. Scrap metal was all his boy had ever known, he said.</p>\n<p>Luis Angel, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, was the youngest of Torres‚Äô five children, a father of three, and the fourth generation to work in <i>chatarro</i>, a business his great grandfather had started out of a pushcart. Now the Torres empire extended to four or five scrapyards. Three months before his arrest, Luis Angel had opened his own.</p>\n<p>The way Torres told the story, on the afternoon following the hijacking, Miguel, a childhood friend of Luis Angel, showed up at Luis Angel‚Äôs new shop with a large wooden crate for sale. ‚ÄúThere was nothing on the outside marking it,‚Äù Torres said. The next day, Luis Angel‚Äôs 16-year-old part-time employee Andres opened the crate and began to unpack the contents. Dust poured out of the box, and he peered inside, noticing a small radiation symbol. Luis Angel and Andres suddenly felt a wave of nausea ‚Äî an early sign of radiation poisoning ‚Äî and rushed to a local clinic.</p>\n<p>As Torres was talking, his daughter wandered into the room. She was also dressed in black. She waved a hand over her soiled shirt and said something about ‚Äúgetting our hands dirty.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Torres continued. Returning from the clinic that night, Luis Angel was frightened. News of the missing materials was making rounds on the radio and on the evening news, and he would have known what he‚Äôd purchased by then. He and Andres loaded up an old Dodge truck and headed out of town. After a while on the dark road, skirting the main highways, the field in Hueypoxtla must have seemed desolate enough.</p>\n<p>Dumping the material was Luis Angel‚Äôs mistake, Torres said, not stealing it. ‚ÄúWe say we‚Äôre innocent. But who‚Äôs going to listen to us?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The following afternoon two men arrived at Andres‚Äô house claiming to have been sent from the public health administration. Upstairs they found Andres, Luis Angel, and a cousin of Luis Angel. In fact they were ministerial police. They had received a tip from the clinic about two men exhibiting signs of radiation poisoning. All three were taken into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"14\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4256414\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"874\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 1517px; top: 826px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4256414','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis whole story about a dirty bomb is a bunch of fantasies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in Mexico City, I had gone to see Juan Eibenschutz at his office in the center of the city.

He talked about the way this gang or that gang operated, and pointed out landmarks. ‚ÄúThere used to be a lot of assaults here. Truckers would pull onto these dirt roads, and a lot of women were raped,‚Äù he said one afternoon as we passed an empty street. He seemed to enjoy being an investigator. He asked a lot of questions, and offered theories of his own. It occurred to me that Marco might have worked in law enforcement. But when I asked, he said, ‚ÄúNo way. Mexican cops are symbols of corruption and mediocrity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Francisco Sanchez lived outside Hueypoxtla on communal farming land. When we pulled into his driveway, he was outside in the shade of a giant flowering prickly pear cactus, the plant that jutted out of the earth everywhere. Sanchez‚Äôs house, like all the houses there, was a hodgepodge of brick, stone, mud, and corrugated tin. The indoor space blended into the outdoors. Hueypoxtla is a windy, dry place, but it‚Äôs never too cold, and the climate is good for growing crops like barley and alfalfa. Marco pointed out that the maguey plant grows wild there. The maguey is the plant used to make <i>pulque</i>, the ancient Aztec spirit, which, also according to Marco, the poorest residents of the region sometimes feed to their children when there‚Äôs nothing else to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"11\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255746\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"440\" height=\"360\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 357px; top: 312px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255746','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That afternoon, Sanchez pointed to his perch under the prickly pears and disappeared into the house, re-emerging with the boxes of the medications he has had to take since he got sick and pictures of his radiation burns that his wife, Yolanda, who was washing dishes in their outdoor sink, had snapped in the hospital. Sanchez had been hospitalized for six weeks with radiation poisoning and still wasn‚Äôt able to expose his skin to sunlight for very long. He was only 41 but looked like an old man, sun-weathered.</p>\n<p>He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and had a large bandage covering his left shoulder and another taped over his hand. Radiation sickness can be fatal, but Sanchez said he‚Äôd had on a thick jacket that morning and had only carried the cylinder a few meters. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, then slowly peeled the bandage to reveal skin that was still seared and pink. Normally, he said, he would have been out in the fields preparing for the summer rains, but he hadn‚Äôt worked since that morning in December. As we were talking, his 9-month-old son wheeled by on a mobile high chair.</p>\n<p>The cornfield was only a couple of kilometers away down the slope of a dusty road, just past the Marie Curie kindergarten. ‚ÄúCrazy about that name, right?‚Äù I said, as we passed the school, to silence.</p>\n<p>I had noticed empty canals lining the fields, and Sanchez explained that effluent from Mexico City was pumped out there, which the farmers use to irrigate their crops.

Finally he let on to a friend. ‚ÄúI was dying of panic,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúPeople ask why I waited so long, but what they don‚Äôt understand is that I was totally blocked.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"12\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255756\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 217px; top: 177px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255756','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>A neighbor, Mauro Moya, a truck driver, took a walk to the field with his son and son-in-law and circled the objects like the farmers had done the day before, measuring and weighing them with their eyes. The biggest piece couldn‚Äôt be lifted with a wheelbarrow or a tractor. But they estimated that the metal was worth $400. It was enough to cover the family‚Äôs expenses for two weeks. Moya hurried back up the hill for his truck. He hooked chains around the shield and dragged it up the road to his property, kicking up a trail of shimmering dust. With the shield safely on his lot, the ecstatic Moya family took turns posing for photos, squatting down beside it, making peace signs, sitting on it, laughing. The celebration didn‚Äôt last long. Someone from the community had already called the police.</p>\n<p>The Moya family soon began to think of their discovery as a curse. Three weeks later, the son-in-law, Juan Antonio Saldivar was arrested in a separate incident for stealing a cement truck. The attorney his family hired told me that the arrest glared with irregularities, chief among them the fact that it preceded the actual crime by half an hour. Officers rifling through his phone saw the photos of the shield and, in an apparent attempt to bolster their profile of Saldivar as a seasoned hijacker, stated in charging documents that he had been ‚Äúdetained‚Äù by authorities ‚Äúin relation to the cobalt-60 theft.‚Äù Authorities questioned his family after the cobalt was recovered at their home but didn‚Äôt arrest them. Saldivar has now been in jail for 11 months and is facing a sentence of 16 years for the cement truck theft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"5\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255519\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 1517px; top: 726px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255519','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Later that day, as we were getting ready to leave Hueypoxtla, Marco pulled up a photograph on his phone of him in a federal police uniform. ‚ÄúI was a federal police officer for 10 years,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>I stared at the image.

But I couldn‚Äôt absorb any of it. The realization dawned that I‚Äôd hired a stranger who might or might not be a crooked ex-policeman to ferry me around the hijacking epicenter of Mexico in search of bandits with possible connections to organized crime or even terrorists and that I was now stuck alone with him in the country. But I wanted to go back to Zumpango to find Andres. Marco knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>I had already gone by the place a couple of times. The story that Torres had told me implicated police officers in a corruption scheme and painted his son as an innocent man. But when I‚Äôd asked to see the truck that Luis Angel had used, he said the family had sold it. There was a third employee in the shop with him that day, but he had disappeared. Miguel was also nowhere to be found. Other details didn‚Äôt add up. Andres had been released by authorities on account of his age.</p>\n<p>At Andres‚Äô house, salsa was blaring and a big red truck was parked inside the gate. A tiny old woman in an apron answered the door. She said no one was home.</p>\n<p>Down the street from the house, I had seen four men drinking cans of Modelo under an awning. ‚ÄúThe truck was right there,‚Äù said one, pointing to a spot down the street, in front of Luis Angel‚Äôs shop, the one that had been raided by police. Torres had told me police had taped it off and the family was stuck paying the rent, but it looked open; a couple of cars were parked inside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy was the truck sitting outside?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were too many trucks in the shop already!‚Äù said another. They all laughed and continued dishing about the Torres family. According to them, Luis Angel had a chop shop. One of Luis Angel‚Äôs co-defendants, a man Torres had told me was a new acquaintance, in fact worked with him, they said, painting the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI live across the street and sometimes there were so many trucks in there they had to park them outside,‚Äù said one of the men.</p>\n<p>What about Miguel? I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one Miguel in this town,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe went to the United States 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The woman from Andres‚Äô house walked down the street toward us.

The place had a disorienting bleached-out quality, like a condensed version of the Inland Empire, and his office was in a row house that looked exactly like all the others on his street.</p>\n<p>Cesar swung open the door. He was short and round, like an egg. He had on a pink shirt, a pink tie, a blue sweater-vest, and blue slacks ‚Äî Danny DeVito and Mr. Rogers at the same time. His partner, a pretty blonde with big brown eyes in a brown pantsuit, descended the stairs. Cesar invited me to have a seat on a brown-and-white leather sectional. I stared down at a zebra-print rug and, to my right, a pair of electric guitars upright in stands, at the ready.</p>\n<p>I had hoped Cesar would give me a copy of the police report and charging documents. Such things can be tough to come by in Mexico, even after a case is closed. The files would clarify the questions I had about the Torres family‚Äôs story and the official versions that police had furnished to local press.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Cesar began. ‚ÄúDo you know how justice works in Mexico?‚Äù My heart sank as he went on. ‚ÄúIf the courts find out that you‚Äôre interviewing witnesses ‚Äî believe me, apart from affecting the defense, there‚Äôs juridical revenge. You start seeing stuff in the newspapers, on the radio, on TV. It just gets very complicated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He stood up. ‚ÄúWhat this case needs right now is for things to cool down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He showed me the door.</p>\n<p>Back home, I followed up with him for a while, but the answer was always the same: He needed more time.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Marco, who had added me on Facebook, posted the photo he‚Äôd shown me in the car of himself in uniform. The comments suggested that Marco‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt know he had ever been a police officer. ‚ÄúWhat clothesline line‚Äôd ya steal that uniform from?‚Äù read one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not from a clothesline. It‚Äôs rented!‚Äù</p>\n<p>I thought back to going to a federal police campus in Mexico City, where Marco told me he‚Äôd been ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù by one of the officers, who observed the particular way he jumped out of a van. A normal person ‚Äî me ‚Äî would exit facing forward. But Marco climbed out sideways, a reflex, he explained, from all his years carrying a long firearm. They‚Äôd spotted him and knew he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Had Marco invented that story? Was he not a police officer accused of corruption? I thought it over for a couple of days. But I decided it was better not to ask him. I didn‚Äôt think I would get a straight answer.</p>\n<p>On June 8, another source of radioactive material was stolen from a warehouse near Zumpango. This time it was a source that authorities considered less dangerous than the cobalt from the December heist. Police weren‚Äôt able to track it, but 10 days later it turned up in a garbage bag by a sewage canal. A security guard who spotted it believed the bag contained a body. Reports said it had sat by the canal untouched for several days, free for anyone to haul away.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"13\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255809\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"623\" alt=\"\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"left: 1517px; top: 575px;\" class=\"pinit\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a rel:sub_title=\"\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255809','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div rel:buzz_num=\"2\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4254612\" class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

One piece, which resembled a water pump or a large diving bell, was so big and heavy he couldn‚Äôt move it. There was also a metal box with a scratched-away label that he couldn‚Äôt read, and a cylinder about 3 feet long, which Sanchez thought he could use to split firewood.</p>\n<p>The other farmers hadn‚Äôt yet arrived, so he grabbed the cylinder with both hands and heaved it over his shoulder, carrying it a few yards over to the corn husks that had been piled in the field to dry. He was sure no one would find it in there.</p>\n<p>Sanchez hadn‚Äôt yet heard the news, but these were parts of a radiation therapy device that Mexico‚Äôs Social Security Institute was replacing throughout state hospitals, stolen from a truck the day before. Even though the machine was considered obsolete as a medical device, it contained 3,000 curies of cobalt-60, a Category 1 (the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/source-reduction-management/sources.html\">most dangerous</a> classification) synthetic radioactive isotope ‚Äî more than enough to kill anyone exposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255733\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 153px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255733','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Pemex in Tepojaco where the robbery occurred. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The hijacking had taken place 12 miles away in Tepojaco, a town popular with truckers traveling in and out of Mexico City. The driver was en route from a public hospital in Tijuana to a nearby disposal site for hazardous waste and had pulled off the highway to sleep in an unlit spot across from a Pemex gas station. At around 1 a.m., he heard a tap on the window and saw two men with guns standing outside. They forced their way into the cab and bound the driver‚Äôs hands.</p>\n<p>The driver‚Äôs partner was in the back and heard the noise of the driver being tied up. He managed to slip away without notice. Security footage revealed little else; the robbery had taken place in the middle of the night. Armando Ramos, a federal agent who responded to the scene, told me that the truck, a white 2007 Volvo, could be made out pulling into a spot directly behind another truck, which obscured it from view. Soon the truck pulled away; the culprits were never seen. There was also no way to guess where the truck had gone.</p>\n<p>The hazardous materials were being transported without security, and though the truck was, according to some early reports, outfitted with GPS, it hadn‚Äôt been turned on ‚Äî which looked suspect. Initially, said Ramos, ‚Äúwe assumed the driver had something to do with it.‚Äù According to one <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzUmf_KoMSAC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=cargo+thefts+mexico+10,000+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsadHeg-Js&amp;sig=ulai6GvErenk8MqhJJU6YcCXLPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryRlVP_GLqbgsAS654LIBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cargo%20thefts%20mexico%2010%2C000%20year&amp;f=false\">study</a>, 10,000 highway cargo thefts occurred per year between 2006 and 2010, a rate of 27 per day, and the highest concentration is in the towns encircling Mexico City ‚Äî and <i>autorobo</i>, when companies are in on the robberies to take a cut as well as collect insurance, is also commonplace.</p>\n<p>That theory was ruled out against the more mundane reality that the hijackers didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd taken. Instead, the thieves had followed a standard script: Rather than hurting the driver, they simply let him out down the road, alive, and continued on, another night‚Äôs work. They would have known that no one was watching them and believed they would not be caught. Victims of crimes often don‚Äôt bother reporting them to police, who aren‚Äôt likely to solve them, and who may have a stake themselves. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/020/2014/en/468aee5a-ecc3-470f-9387-a8a10b5670cc/amr410202014en.pdf\">According to Amnesty International</a>, complaints of civil rights violations at the hands of authorities have increased 600% between 2003 and 2013.</p>\n<p>But this robbery broke through, ascending to an increasingly rare category in Mexico: that of a notorious, headline-making crime. The hijackers who thought they were pulling off another score instead had pulled off the most brazen theft of radioactive materials in memory. Twenty-four hours later, the world knew what they‚Äôd done.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. networks devoted coverage to the missing ‚Äúingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb,‚Äù in the words of one headline. The White House said it was ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the situation. Juan Eibenschutz, the director of Mexico‚Äôs National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, who‚Äôd flown straight home from Paris to handle the crisis, made a public plea: ‚ÄúIf anyone finds a big chunk of metal with radiation symbols all over it they should notify us immediately.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the world of nuclear safety, stories of mishaps and misidentification abound. The <a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">most infamous case</a> involves a Brazilian man who was so mesmerized by the cesium-137 capsule that turned up in his junkyard that he opened it up and passed out the contents to neighbors, who rubbed it on their skin. Even in Mexico this had happened before: A source of cobalt-60 was melted into rebar that became dining table legs bound for the U.S. market; they weren‚Äôt discovered until a delivery truck took a wrong turn in the vicinity of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered alarms.</p>\n<p>But this was a theft, not an accident, perpetrated in the midst of a vast economy thriving on the traffic of illicit, dangerous things. What if the cobalt-60 was removed from its protective encasement, sold, and harnessed for a dirty bomb ‚Äî an apocalyptic twist straight out of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>? Mexican officials privately believed that a terrorist plot was as unlikely as the Doomsday Machine. But as long as the cobalt-60 was missing, the possibility couldn‚Äôt be dismissed. The International Atomic Energy Agency deemed the teletherapy machine ‚Äúextremely dangerous.‚Äù Eibenschutz added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost absolutely certain that whoever removed this material by hand is either dead or about to die.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared as the latest crisis on the evening news, the cobalt-60 was safely recovered and the story vanished. A year ‚Äî and zero known radiation-related fatalities ‚Äî later, it‚Äôs still not clear who was behind the theft. And whether that‚Äôs a cause for relief or a cause for greater worry is up for debate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255338\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"908\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 860px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255338','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Adam Setala for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Removed from the country, it‚Äôs easy to think of Mexico as suffering from a single form of cartel-related bloodshed. But up close, a more insidious form of violence has crept in. Criminal organizations once devoted to trafficking drugs have diversified widely: A single recent operation against La Familia Michoacana, a militant group with a mythically devout ethos, revealed that the group had sold 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore in China for $42 million. In 2012, Mexico estimated that in lost wages, foreign investments, and public health bills, crime at large had siphoned $16.5 billion, or 1.3%, from the GDP. Overall killings are down, but in a recent <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/mexico-crime-survey-reveals-conflicting-trends\">self-reported survey</a>, kidnapping and extortion were up. And everyday crimes are the ones that pull at the social fabric, making life and labor miserable. Perhaps most instructive of all: The perception of violence has risen. More Mexicans feel less safe.</p>\n<p>President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto recently attempted to address the problem by unveiling a special economic crimes task force composed of fresh-faced officers who, as a selling point, had never before worked for the police. Though, as one analyst told the Associated Press in a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mexico-creates-special-economic-crime-force-0\">report</a> about the new gendarmerie, ‚ÄúWe have been creating new police forces for decades ‚Äî armored police, ‚Äòincorruptible, super-trained police.‚Äô‚Äù But to little effect.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the December hijacking, little focus went to the thieves or the farmers who found the cobalt. The five men arrested allegedly belonged to a truck theft gang centered in Zumpango, a commuter town on the Mexico state‚ÄìHidalgo border, booked within days of the robbery. Local police had rounded up the suspects and handed them over to federal agents. The Mexican government often trumpets its marquee arrests, but the attorney general‚Äôs office couldn‚Äôt even dig up a press release when I called. And so, along with the culprits, the other issues surrounding the hijacking that had roused public attention ‚Äî the fact that government contractors were transporting lethal radioactive waste through gang-rife territory without security or even GPS ‚Äî were soon forgotten. People were understandably less interested in some common thieves than the specter of a dirty bomb. There‚Äôd been no media parades showcasing the suspects, no presidential tweets, only a quiet booking. The men were shipped off to a federal prison in Tamaulipas to await judgment.</p>\n<p>Five months after the hijacking, I flew to Mexico City. I hired a driver, Marco Callejas, to get around the towns outside the capital, and he picked me up in front of a Starbucks on a sunny morning last May. Marco wore a sporty uniform of track pants, sneakers, and wraparound sunglasses like the kind off-duty police officers wear. His car was an old maroon Tsuru, Mexico‚Äôs ubiquitous Nissan Sentra. The taxi company had randomly assigned him, so when Marco said he‚Äôd grown up near Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state, which forms a triangle with Tepojaco, where the cobalt-60 was stolen, and the cornfield in Hueypoxtla where it was found, it felt comforting, like good luck. Marco patted the front seat, the only one besides his with a belt. ‚ÄúCome on up!‚Äù he said. I climbed in.</p>\n<p>As Marco and I drove out of Mexico City, I asked if he remembered the hijacking. ‚ÄúGosh, it would be so easy to cross something like that over the border.‚Äù Marco shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing the Mexicans and the Arabs aren‚Äôt friends!‚Äù</p>\n<p>We took a road veering off the highway and drove for a long time on dirt roads, passing through small towns. The countryside looked like an old Western stage setting with cacti and mountains in the distance, except for the billboards advertising a hotline for kidnapping victims and the highway sign riddled with bullet holes. None of the addresses we plugged into the GPS seemed to work. So we stopped a man on a horse for directions.</p>\n<p>In Zumpango, we pulled up to the scrapyard belonging to one of the alleged thieves, Luis Angel Torres. His father, also named Luis, was standing in front talking to a customer with his arms crossed over a black T-shirt that read ‚ÄúThe Queen of Convenience Stores Works Here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He led us through the scrapyard‚Äôs receiving garage, which opened up to a large sorting area where workers were crushing metal into perfectly compressed squares. According to the family, Luis Angel was accused of, among other things, dismantling the stolen truck, crushing it to pieces, and selling it off. (Luis Angel is facing charges relating to organized crime and abandonment of radioactive materials, according to the family‚Äôs attorney; repeated requests for information about the hijacking from state and federal officials were denied or ignored.) The office was painted bright lavender and had a large shrine to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Torres made himself comfortable. He put his feet up on the desk, over a collage of family photos overlaid with plastic. Torres said he was a family man. Scrap metal was all his boy had ever known, he said.</p>\n<p>Luis Angel, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, was the youngest of Torres‚Äô five children, a father of three, and the fourth generation to work in <i>chatarro</i>, a business his great grandfather had started out of a pushcart. Now the Torres empire extended to four or five scrapyards. Three months before his arrest, Luis Angel had opened his own.</p>\n<p>The way Torres told the story, on the afternoon following the hijacking, Miguel, a childhood friend of Luis Angel, showed up at Luis Angel‚Äôs new shop with a large wooden crate for sale. ‚ÄúThere was nothing on the outside marking it,‚Äù Torres said. The next day, Luis Angel‚Äôs 16-year-old part-time employee Andres opened the crate and began to unpack the contents. Dust poured out of the box, and he peered inside, noticing a small radiation symbol. Luis Angel and Andres suddenly felt a wave of nausea ‚Äî an early sign of radiation poisoning ‚Äî and rushed to a local clinic.</p>\n<p>As Torres was talking, his daughter wandered into the room. She was also dressed in black. She waved a hand over her soiled shirt and said something about ‚Äúgetting our hands dirty.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Torres continued. Returning from the clinic that night, Luis Angel was frightened. News of the missing materials was making rounds on the radio and on the evening news, and he would have known what he‚Äôd purchased by then. He and Andres loaded up an old Dodge truck and headed out of town. After a while on the dark road, skirting the main highways, the field in Hueypoxtla must have seemed desolate enough.</p>\n<p>Dumping the material was Luis Angel‚Äôs mistake, Torres said, not stealing it. ‚ÄúWe say we‚Äôre innocent. But who‚Äôs going to listen to us?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The following afternoon two men arrived at Andres‚Äô house claiming to have been sent from the public health administration. Upstairs they found Andres, Luis Angel, and a cousin of Luis Angel. In fact they were ministerial police. They had received a tip from the clinic about two men exhibiting signs of radiation poisoning. All three were taken into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4256414\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"874\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 826px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4256414','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis whole story about a dirty bomb is a bunch of fantasies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in Mexico City, I had gone to see Juan Eibenschutz at his office in the center of the city.

He asked a lot of questions, and offered theories of his own. It occurred to me that Marco might have worked in law enforcement. But when I asked, he said, ‚ÄúNo way. Mexican cops are symbols of corruption and mediocrity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Francisco Sanchez lived outside Hueypoxtla on communal farming land. When we pulled into his driveway, he was outside in the shade of a giant flowering prickly pear cactus, the plant that jutted out of the earth everywhere. Sanchez‚Äôs house, like all the houses there, was a hodgepodge of brick, stone, mud, and corrugated tin. The indoor space blended into the outdoors. Hueypoxtla is a windy, dry place, but it‚Äôs never too cold, and the climate is good for growing crops like barley and alfalfa. Marco pointed out that the maguey plant grows wild there. The maguey is the plant used to make <i>pulque</i>, the ancient Aztec spirit, which, also according to Marco, the poorest residents of the region sometimes feed to their children when there‚Äôs nothing else to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255746\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"360\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 312px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255746','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That afternoon, Sanchez pointed to his perch under the prickly pears and disappeared into the house, re-emerging with the boxes of the medications he has had to take since he got sick and pictures of his radiation burns that his wife, Yolanda, who was washing dishes in their outdoor sink, had snapped in the hospital. Sanchez had been hospitalized for six weeks with radiation poisoning and still wasn‚Äôt able to expose his skin to sunlight for very long. He was only 41 but looked like an old man, sun-weathered.</p>\n<p>He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and had a large bandage covering his left shoulder and another taped over his hand. Radiation sickness can be fatal, but Sanchez said he‚Äôd had on a thick jacket that morning and had only carried the cylinder a few meters. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, then slowly peeled the bandage to reveal skin that was still seared and pink. Normally, he said, he would have been out in the fields preparing for the summer rains, but he hadn‚Äôt worked since that morning in December. As we were talking, his 9-month-old son wheeled by on a mobile high chair.</p>\n<p>The cornfield was only a couple of kilometers away down the slope of a dusty road, just past the Marie Curie kindergarten. ‚ÄúCrazy about that name, right?‚Äù I said, as we passed the school, to silence.</p>\n<p>I had noticed empty canals lining the fields, and Sanchez explained that effluent from Mexico City was pumped out there, which the farmers use to irrigate their crops. I imagined the wastewater-fed crops being sold back to the capital and being consumed and then surging back through the pipes to Hueypoxtla like some giant closed-loop digestive tract.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255712\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 282px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255712','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>We reached the field. Stepping out of the car, Sanchez seemed possessed by his memory. He retraced his steps, circling the place he‚Äôd found the cylinder. He had noticed six deep tire ruts that morning, indicating to him that whoever discarded the materials had labored to do so. One of the tracks was still visible, baked into the earth. He straightened his back and swept his arm, motioning to the emptiness. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone leave this here?‚Äù</p>\n<p>After he hid the cylinder, Sanchez had felt ill and experienced what he called ‚Äúa tremendous vomit,‚Äù but he hadn‚Äôt made the connection, so he went back to work, and he didn‚Äôt tell anyone what he‚Äôd found. Throughout the day others had tried to move the parts. The biggest piece, the shield, was too heavy, and night fell with the pieces as Sanchez had found them.</p>\n<p>For the first week, Sanchez had been afraid to talk about what was happening to him, even as 100 Marines, federal agents, and local police cordoned off the field and <a href=\"http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/10/cobalt-60-still-sitting-in-mexican-cornfield/\">dispatched a robot</a> to retrieve the cobalt. He watched the evening news, clutching his son tightly, and asked Yolanda to rub ointment on his shoulder.

The biggest piece couldn‚Äôt be lifted with a wheelbarrow or a tractor. But they estimated that the metal was worth $400. It was enough to cover the family‚Äôs expenses for two weeks. Moya hurried back up the hill for his truck. He hooked chains around the shield and dragged it up the road to his property, kicking up a trail of shimmering dust. With the shield safely on his lot, the ecstatic Moya family took turns posing for photos, squatting down beside it, making peace signs, sitting on it, laughing. The celebration didn‚Äôt last long. Someone from the community had already called the police.</p>\n<p>The Moya family soon began to think of their discovery as a curse. Three weeks later, the son-in-law, Juan Antonio Saldivar was arrested in a separate incident for stealing a cement truck. The attorney his family hired told me that the arrest glared with irregularities, chief among them the fact that it preceded the actual crime by half an hour. Officers rifling through his phone saw the photos of the shield and, in an apparent attempt to bolster their profile of Saldivar as a seasoned hijacker, stated in charging documents that he had been ‚Äúdetained‚Äù by authorities ‚Äúin relation to the cobalt-60 theft.‚Äù Authorities questioned his family after the cobalt was recovered at their home but didn‚Äôt arrest them. Saldivar has now been in jail for 11 months and is facing a sentence of 16 years for the cement truck theft.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255519\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 726px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255519','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-8054-1415926294-27.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Later that day, as we were getting ready to leave Hueypoxtla, Marco pulled up a photograph on his phone of him in a federal police uniform. ‚ÄúI was a federal police officer for 10 years,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>I stared at the image.

But I couldn‚Äôt absorb any of it. The realization dawned that I‚Äôd hired a stranger who might or might not be a crooked ex-policeman to ferry me around the hijacking epicenter of Mexico in search of bandits with possible connections to organized crime or even terrorists and that I was now stuck alone with him in the country. But I wanted to go back to Zumpango to find Andres. Marco knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>I had already gone by the place a couple of times. The story that Torres had told me implicated police officers in a corruption scheme and painted his son as an innocent man. But when I‚Äôd asked to see the truck that Luis Angel had used, he said the family had sold it. There was a third employee in the shop with him that day, but he had disappeared. Miguel was also nowhere to be found. Other details didn‚Äôt add up. Andres had been released by authorities on account of his age.</p>\n<p>At Andres‚Äô house, salsa was blaring and a big red truck was parked inside the gate. A tiny old woman in an apron answered the door. She said no one was home.</p>\n<p>Down the street from the house, I had seen four men drinking cans of Modelo under an awning. ‚ÄúThe truck was right there,‚Äù said one, pointing to a spot down the street, in front of Luis Angel‚Äôs shop, the one that had been raided by police. Torres had told me police had taped it off and the family was stuck paying the rent, but it looked open; a couple of cars were parked inside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy was the truck sitting outside?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were too many trucks in the shop already!‚Äù said another. They all laughed and continued dishing about the Torres family. According to them, Luis Angel had a chop shop. One of Luis Angel‚Äôs co-defendants, a man Torres had told me was a new acquaintance, in fact worked with him, they said, painting the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI live across the street and sometimes there were so many trucks in there they had to park them outside,‚Äù said one of the men.</p>\n<p>What about Miguel? I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one Miguel in this town,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe went to the United States 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The woman from Andres‚Äô house walked down the street toward us.

He was short and round, like an egg. He had on a pink shirt, a pink tie, a blue sweater-vest, and blue slacks ‚Äî Danny DeVito and Mr. Rogers at the same time. His partner, a pretty blonde with big brown eyes in a brown pantsuit, descended the stairs. Cesar invited me to have a seat on a brown-and-white leather sectional.

It‚Äôs rented!‚Äù</p>\n<p>I thought back to going to a federal police campus in Mexico City, where Marco told me he‚Äôd been ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù by one of the officers, who observed the particular way he jumped out of a van. A normal person ‚Äî me ‚Äî would exit facing forward. But Marco climbed out sideways, a reflex, he explained, from all his years carrying a long firearm. They‚Äôd spotted him and knew he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Had Marco invented that story? Was he not a police officer accused of corruption? I thought it over for a couple of days. But I decided it was better not to ask him. I didn‚Äôt think I would get a straight answer.</p>\n<p>On June 8, another source of radioactive material was stolen from a warehouse near Zumpango. This time it was a source that authorities considered less dangerous than the cobalt from the December heist. Police weren‚Äôt able to track it, but 10 days later it turned up in a garbage bag by a sewage canal. A security guard who spotted it believed the bag contained a body. Reports said it had sat by the canal untouched for several days, free for anyone to haul away.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255809\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"623\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 575px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255809','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4254612\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

One piece, which resembled a water pump or a large diving bell, was so big and heavy he couldn‚Äôt move it. There was also a metal box with a scratched-away label that he couldn‚Äôt read, and a cylinder about 3 feet long, which Sanchez thought he could use to split firewood.</p>\n<p>The other farmers hadn‚Äôt yet arrived, so he grabbed the cylinder with both hands and heaved it over his shoulder, carrying it a few yards over to the corn husks that had been piled in the field to dry. He was sure no one would find it in there.</p>\n<p>Sanchez hadn‚Äôt yet heard the news, but these were parts of a radiation therapy device that Mexico‚Äôs Social Security Institute was replacing throughout state hospitals, stolen from a truck the day before. Even though the machine was considered obsolete as a medical device, it contained 3,000 curies of cobalt-60, a Category 1 (the <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/radiation/source-reduction-management/sources.html\">most dangerous</a> classification) synthetic radioactive isotope ‚Äî more than enough to kill anyone exposed to it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255733\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 153px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255733','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4059-1415927935-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Pemex in Tepojaco where the robbery occurred. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The hijacking had taken place 12 miles away in Tepojaco, a town popular with truckers traveling in and out of Mexico City. The driver was en route from a public hospital in Tijuana to a nearby disposal site for hazardous waste and had pulled off the highway to sleep in an unlit spot across from a Pemex gas station. At around 1 a.m., he heard a tap on the window and saw two men with guns standing outside. They forced their way into the cab and bound the driver‚Äôs hands.</p>\n<p>The driver‚Äôs partner was in the back and heard the noise of the driver being tied up. He managed to slip away without notice. Security footage revealed little else; the robbery had taken place in the middle of the night. Armando Ramos, a federal agent who responded to the scene, told me that the truck, a white 2007 Volvo, could be made out pulling into a spot directly behind another truck, which obscured it from view. Soon the truck pulled away; the culprits were never seen. There was also no way to guess where the truck had gone.</p>\n<p>The hazardous materials were being transported without security, and though the truck was, according to some early reports, outfitted with GPS, it hadn‚Äôt been turned on ‚Äî which looked suspect. Initially, said Ramos, ‚Äúwe assumed the driver had something to do with it.‚Äù According to one <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzUmf_KoMSAC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;lpg=PA291&amp;dq=cargo+thefts+mexico+10,000+year&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BsadHeg-Js&amp;sig=ulai6GvErenk8MqhJJU6YcCXLPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ryRlVP_GLqbgsAS654LIBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cargo%20thefts%20mexico%2010%2C000%20year&amp;f=false\">study</a>, 10,000 highway cargo thefts occurred per year between 2006 and 2010, a rate of 27 per day, and the highest concentration is in the towns encircling Mexico City ‚Äî and <i>autorobo</i>, when companies are in on the robberies to take a cut as well as collect insurance, is also commonplace.</p>\n<p>That theory was ruled out against the more mundane reality that the hijackers didn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd taken. Instead, the thieves had followed a standard script: Rather than hurting the driver, they simply let him out down the road, alive, and continued on, another night‚Äôs work. They would have known that no one was watching them and believed they would not be caught. Victims of crimes often don‚Äôt bother reporting them to police, who aren‚Äôt likely to solve them, and who may have a stake themselves. <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/020/2014/en/468aee5a-ecc3-470f-9387-a8a10b5670cc/amr410202014en.pdf\">According to Amnesty International</a>, complaints of civil rights violations at the hands of authorities have increased 600% between 2003 and 2013.</p>\n<p>But this robbery broke through, ascending to an increasingly rare category in Mexico: that of a notorious, headline-making crime. The hijackers who thought they were pulling off another score instead had pulled off the most brazen theft of radioactive materials in memory. Twenty-four hours later, the world knew what they‚Äôd done.</p>\n<p>Major U.S. networks devoted coverage to the missing ‚Äúingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb,‚Äù in the words of one headline. The White House said it was ‚Äúclosely monitoring‚Äù the situation. Juan Eibenschutz, the director of Mexico‚Äôs National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, who‚Äôd flown straight home from Paris to handle the crisis, made a public plea: ‚ÄúIf anyone finds a big chunk of metal with radiation symbols all over it they should notify us immediately.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In the world of nuclear safety, stories of mishaps and misidentification abound. The <a href=\"http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub815_web.pdf\">most infamous case</a> involves a Brazilian man who was so mesmerized by the cesium-137 capsule that turned up in his junkyard that he opened it up and passed out the contents to neighbors, who rubbed it on their skin. Even in Mexico this had happened before: A source of cobalt-60 was melted into rebar that became dining table legs bound for the U.S. market; they weren‚Äôt discovered until a delivery truck took a wrong turn in the vicinity of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and triggered alarms.</p>\n<p>But this was a theft, not an accident, perpetrated in the midst of a vast economy thriving on the traffic of illicit, dangerous things. What if the cobalt-60 was removed from its protective encasement, sold, and harnessed for a dirty bomb ‚Äî an apocalyptic twist straight out of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>? Mexican officials privately believed that a terrorist plot was as unlikely as the Doomsday Machine. But as long as the cobalt-60 was missing, the possibility couldn‚Äôt be dismissed. The International Atomic Energy Agency deemed the teletherapy machine ‚Äúextremely dangerous.‚Äù Eibenschutz added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost absolutely certain that whoever removed this material by hand is either dead or about to die.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared as the latest crisis on the evening news, the cobalt-60 was safely recovered and the story vanished. A year ‚Äî and zero known radiation-related fatalities ‚Äî later, it‚Äôs still not clear who was behind the theft. And whether that‚Äôs a cause for relief or a cause for greater worry is up for debate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255338\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"908\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 860px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255338','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-29014-1415926096-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Adam Setala for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Removed from the country, it‚Äôs easy to think of Mexico as suffering from a single form of cartel-related bloodshed. But up close, a more insidious form of violence has crept in. Criminal organizations once devoted to trafficking drugs have diversified widely: A single recent operation against La Familia Michoacana, a militant group with a mythically devout ethos, revealed that the group had sold 1.1 million tons of illegally extracted iron ore in China for $42 million. In 2012, Mexico estimated that in lost wages, foreign investments, and public health bills, crime at large had siphoned $16.5 billion, or 1.3%, from the GDP. Overall killings are down, but in a recent <a href=\"http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/mexico-crime-survey-reveals-conflicting-trends\">self-reported survey</a>, kidnapping and extortion were up. And everyday crimes are the ones that pull at the social fabric, making life and labor miserable. Perhaps most instructive of all: The perception of violence has risen. More Mexicans feel less safe.</p>\n<p>President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto recently attempted to address the problem by unveiling a special economic crimes task force composed of fresh-faced officers who, as a selling point, had never before worked for the police. Though, as one analyst told the Associated Press in a <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/mexico-creates-special-economic-crime-force-0\">report</a> about the new gendarmerie, ‚ÄúWe have been creating new police forces for decades ‚Äî armored police, ‚Äòincorruptible, super-trained police.‚Äô‚Äù But to little effect.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the December hijacking, little focus went to the thieves or the farmers who found the cobalt. The five men arrested allegedly belonged to a truck theft gang centered in Zumpango, a commuter town on the Mexico state‚ÄìHidalgo border, booked within days of the robbery. Local police had rounded up the suspects and handed them over to federal agents. The Mexican government often trumpets its marquee arrests, but the attorney general‚Äôs office couldn‚Äôt even dig up a press release when I called. And so, along with the culprits, the other issues surrounding the hijacking that had roused public attention ‚Äî the fact that government contractors were transporting lethal radioactive waste through gang-rife territory without security or even GPS ‚Äî were soon forgotten. People were understandably less interested in some common thieves than the specter of a dirty bomb. There‚Äôd been no media parades showcasing the suspects, no presidential tweets, only a quiet booking. The men were shipped off to a federal prison in Tamaulipas to await judgment.</p>\n<p>Five months after the hijacking, I flew to Mexico City. I hired a driver, Marco Callejas, to get around the towns outside the capital, and he picked me up in front of a Starbucks on a sunny morning last May. Marco wore a sporty uniform of track pants, sneakers, and wraparound sunglasses like the kind off-duty police officers wear. His car was an old maroon Tsuru, Mexico‚Äôs ubiquitous Nissan Sentra. The taxi company had randomly assigned him, so when Marco said he‚Äôd grown up near Pachuca, the capital of Hidalgo state, which forms a triangle with Tepojaco, where the cobalt-60 was stolen, and the cornfield in Hueypoxtla where it was found, it felt comforting, like good luck. Marco patted the front seat, the only one besides his with a belt. ‚ÄúCome on up!‚Äù he said. I climbed in.</p>\n<p>As Marco and I drove out of Mexico City, I asked if he remembered the hijacking. ‚ÄúGosh, it would be so easy to cross something like that over the border.‚Äù Marco shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing the Mexicans and the Arabs aren‚Äôt friends!‚Äù</p>\n<p>We took a road veering off the highway and drove for a long time on dirt roads, passing through small towns. The countryside looked like an old Western stage setting with cacti and mountains in the distance, except for the billboards advertising a hotline for kidnapping victims and the highway sign riddled with bullet holes. None of the addresses we plugged into the GPS seemed to work. So we stopped a man on a horse for directions.</p>\n<p>In Zumpango, we pulled up to the scrapyard belonging to one of the alleged thieves, Luis Angel Torres. His father, also named Luis, was standing in front talking to a customer with his arms crossed over a black T-shirt that read ‚ÄúThe Queen of Convenience Stores Works Here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He led us through the scrapyard‚Äôs receiving garage, which opened up to a large sorting area where workers were crushing metal into perfectly compressed squares. According to the family, Luis Angel was accused of, among other things, dismantling the stolen truck, crushing it to pieces, and selling it off. (Luis Angel is facing charges relating to organized crime and abandonment of radioactive materials, according to the family‚Äôs attorney; repeated requests for information about the hijacking from state and federal officials were denied or ignored.) The office was painted bright lavender and had a large shrine to Jesus.</p>\n<p>Torres made himself comfortable. He put his feet up on the desk, over a collage of family photos overlaid with plastic. Torres said he was a family man. Scrap metal was all his boy had ever known, he said.</p>\n<p>Luis Angel, who was 25 at the time of his arrest, was the youngest of Torres‚Äô five children, a father of three, and the fourth generation to work in <i>chatarro</i>, a business his great grandfather had started out of a pushcart. Now the Torres empire extended to four or five scrapyards. Three months before his arrest, Luis Angel had opened his own.</p>\n<p>The way Torres told the story, on the afternoon following the hijacking, Miguel, a childhood friend of Luis Angel, showed up at Luis Angel‚Äôs new shop with a large wooden crate for sale. ‚ÄúThere was nothing on the outside marking it,‚Äù Torres said. The next day, Luis Angel‚Äôs 16-year-old part-time employee Andres opened the crate and began to unpack the contents. Dust poured out of the box, and he peered inside, noticing a small radiation symbol. Luis Angel and Andres suddenly felt a wave of nausea ‚Äî an early sign of radiation poisoning ‚Äî and rushed to a local clinic.</p>\n<p>As Torres was talking, his daughter wandered into the room. She was also dressed in black. She waved a hand over her soiled shirt and said something about ‚Äúgetting our hands dirty.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Torres continued. Returning from the clinic that night, Luis Angel was frightened. News of the missing materials was making rounds on the radio and on the evening news, and he would have known what he‚Äôd purchased by then. He and Andres loaded up an old Dodge truck and headed out of town. After a while on the dark road, skirting the main highways, the field in Hueypoxtla must have seemed desolate enough.</p>\n<p>Dumping the material was Luis Angel‚Äôs mistake, Torres said, not stealing it. ‚ÄúWe say we‚Äôre innocent. But who‚Äôs going to listen to us?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The following afternoon two men arrived at Andres‚Äô house claiming to have been sent from the public health administration. Upstairs they found Andres, Luis Angel, and a cousin of Luis Angel. In fact they were ministerial police. They had received a tip from the clinic about two men exhibiting signs of radiation poisoning. All three were taken into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4256414\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"874\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 826px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4256414','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/23/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-19306-1415938616-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThis whole story about a dirty bomb is a bunch of fantasies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in Mexico City, I had gone to see Juan Eibenschutz at his office in the center of the city.

He talked about the way this gang or that gang operated, and pointed out landmarks. ‚ÄúThere used to be a lot of assaults here. Truckers would pull onto these dirt roads, and a lot of women were raped,‚Äù he said one afternoon as we passed an empty street. He seemed to enjoy being an investigator. He asked a lot of questions, and offered theories of his own. It occurred to me that Marco might have worked in law enforcement. But when I asked, he said, ‚ÄúNo way. Mexican cops are symbols of corruption and mediocrity.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Francisco Sanchez lived outside Hueypoxtla on communal farming land. When we pulled into his driveway, he was outside in the shade of a giant flowering prickly pear cactus, the plant that jutted out of the earth everywhere. Sanchez‚Äôs house, like all the houses there, was a hodgepodge of brick, stone, mud, and corrugated tin. The indoor space blended into the outdoors. Hueypoxtla is a windy, dry place, but it‚Äôs never too cold, and the climate is good for growing crops like barley and alfalfa. Marco pointed out that the maguey plant grows wild there. The maguey is the plant used to make <i>pulque</i>, the ancient Aztec spirit, which, also according to Marco, the poorest residents of the region sometimes feed to their children when there‚Äôs nothing else to eat.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255746\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"360\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 312px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255746','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-6582-1415928068-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That afternoon, Sanchez pointed to his perch under the prickly pears and disappeared into the house, re-emerging with the boxes of the medications he has had to take since he got sick and pictures of his radiation burns that his wife, Yolanda, who was washing dishes in their outdoor sink, had snapped in the hospital. Sanchez had been hospitalized for six weeks with radiation poisoning and still wasn‚Äôt able to expose his skin to sunlight for very long. He was only 41 but looked like an old man, sun-weathered.</p>\n<p>He wasn‚Äôt wearing a shirt and had a large bandage covering his left shoulder and another taped over his hand. Radiation sickness can be fatal, but Sanchez said he‚Äôd had on a thick jacket that morning and had only carried the cylinder a few meters. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said, then slowly peeled the bandage to reveal skin that was still seared and pink. Normally, he said, he would have been out in the fields preparing for the summer rains, but he hadn‚Äôt worked since that morning in December. As we were talking, his 9-month-old son wheeled by on a mobile high chair.</p>\n<p>The cornfield was only a couple of kilometers away down the slope of a dusty road, just past the Marie Curie kindergarten. ‚ÄúCrazy about that name, right?‚Äù I said, as we passed the school, to silence.</p>\n<p>I had noticed empty canals lining the fields, and Sanchez explained that effluent from Mexico City was pumped out there, which the farmers use to irrigate their crops. I imagined the wastewater-fed crops being sold back to the capital and being consumed and then surging back through the pipes to Hueypoxtla like some giant closed-loop digestive tract.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255712\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"330\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 282px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255712','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-15654-1415927605-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>We reached the field.

He had noticed six deep tire ruts that morning, indicating to him that whoever discarded the materials had labored to do so. One of the tracks was still visible, baked into the earth. He straightened his back and swept his arm, motioning to the emptiness. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone leave this here?‚Äù</p>\n<p>After he hid the cylinder, Sanchez had felt ill and experienced what he called ‚Äúa tremendous vomit,‚Äù but he hadn‚Äôt made the connection, so he went back to work, and he didn‚Äôt tell anyone what he‚Äôd found. Throughout the day others had tried to move the parts. The biggest piece, the shield, was too heavy, and night fell with the pieces as Sanchez had found them.</p>\n<p>For the first week, Sanchez had been afraid to talk about what was happening to him, even as 100 Marines, federal agents, and local police cordoned off the field and <a href=\"http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/dec/10/cobalt-60-still-sitting-in-mexican-cornfield/\">dispatched a robot</a> to retrieve the cobalt. He watched the evening news, clutching his son tightly, and asked Yolanda to rub ointment on his shoulder. Finally he let on to a friend. ‚ÄúI was dying of panic,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúPeople ask why I waited so long, but what they don‚Äôt understand is that I was totally blocked.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255756\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 177px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255756','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-643-1415928172-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>A neighbor, Mauro Moya, a truck driver, took a walk to the field with his son and son-in-law and circled the objects like the farmers had done the day before, measuring and weighing them with their eyes. The biggest piece couldn‚Äôt be lifted with a wheelbarrow or a tractor. But they estimated that the metal was worth $400. It was enough to cover the family‚Äôs expenses for two weeks. Moya hurried back up the hill for his truck. He hooked chains around the shield and dragged it up the road to his property, kicking up a trail of shimmering dust. With the shield safely on his lot, the ecstatic Moya family took turns posing for photos, squatting down beside it, making peace signs, sitting on it, laughing. The celebration didn‚Äôt last long. Someone from the community had already called the police.</p>\n<p>The Moya family soon began to think of their discovery as a curse. Three weeks later, the son-in-law, Juan Antonio Saldivar was arrested in a separate incident for stealing a cement truck. The attorney his family hired told me that the arrest glared with irregularities, chief among them the fact that it preceded the actual crime by half an hour. Officers rifling through his phone saw the photos of the shield and, in an apparent attempt to bolster their profile of Saldivar as a seasoned hijacker, stated in charging documents that he had been ‚Äúdetained‚Äù by authorities ‚Äúin relation to the cobalt-60 theft.‚Äù Authorities questioned his family after the cobalt was recovered at their home but didn‚Äôt arrest them.

But I couldn‚Äôt absorb any of it. The realization dawned that I‚Äôd hired a stranger who might or might not be a crooked ex-policeman to ferry me around the hijacking epicenter of Mexico in search of bandits with possible connections to organized crime or even terrorists and that I was now stuck alone with him in the country. But I wanted to go back to Zumpango to find Andres. Marco knew how to get there.</p>\n<p>I had already gone by the place a couple of times. The story that Torres had told me implicated police officers in a corruption scheme and painted his son as an innocent man. But when I‚Äôd asked to see the truck that Luis Angel had used, he said the family had sold it. There was a third employee in the shop with him that day, but he had disappeared. Miguel was also nowhere to be found. Other details didn‚Äôt add up. Andres had been released by authorities on account of his age.</p>\n<p>At Andres‚Äô house, salsa was blaring and a big red truck was parked inside the gate. A tiny old woman in an apron answered the door. She said no one was home.</p>\n<p>Down the street from the house, I had seen four men drinking cans of Modelo under an awning. ‚ÄúThe truck was right there,‚Äù said one, pointing to a spot down the street, in front of Luis Angel‚Äôs shop, the one that had been raided by police. Torres had told me police had taped it off and the family was stuck paying the rent, but it looked open; a couple of cars were parked inside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy was the truck sitting outside?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were too many trucks in the shop already!‚Äù said another. They all laughed and continued dishing about the Torres family. According to them, Luis Angel had a chop shop. One of Luis Angel‚Äôs co-defendants, a man Torres had told me was a new acquaintance, in fact worked with him, they said, painting the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI live across the street and sometimes there were so many trucks in there they had to park them outside,‚Äù said one of the men.</p>\n<p>What about Miguel? I asked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one Miguel in this town,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúHe went to the United States 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The woman from Andres‚Äô house walked down the street toward us. She passed the group in silence, looking straight ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255716\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14611-1415927698-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14611-1415927698-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"902\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 854px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255716','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14611-1415927698-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photo by Mary Cuddehe for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Julio Cesar, the Torres family‚Äôs attorney, had an office in a development outside Mexico City. The place had a disorienting bleached-out quality, like a condensed version of the Inland Empire, and his office was in a row house that looked exactly like all the others on his street.</p>\n<p>Cesar swung open the door. He was short and round, like an egg. He had on a pink shirt, a pink tie, a blue sweater-vest, and blue slacks ‚Äî Danny DeVito and Mr. Rogers at the same time. His partner, a pretty blonde with big brown eyes in a brown pantsuit, descended the stairs. Cesar invited me to have a seat on a brown-and-white leather sectional. I stared down at a zebra-print rug and, to my right, a pair of electric guitars upright in stands, at the ready.</p>\n<p>I had hoped Cesar would give me a copy of the police report and charging documents. Such things can be tough to come by in Mexico, even after a case is closed. The files would clarify the questions I had about the Torres family‚Äôs story and the official versions that police had furnished to local press.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Cesar began. ‚ÄúDo you know how justice works in Mexico?‚Äù My heart sank as he went on. ‚ÄúIf the courts find out that you‚Äôre interviewing witnesses ‚Äî believe me, apart from affecting the defense, there‚Äôs juridical revenge. You start seeing stuff in the newspapers, on the radio, on TV. It just gets very complicated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He stood up. ‚ÄúWhat this case needs right now is for things to cool down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He showed me the door.</p>\n<p>Back home, I followed up with him for a while, but the answer was always the same: He needed more time.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Marco, who had added me on Facebook, posted the photo he‚Äôd shown me in the car of himself in uniform. The comments suggested that Marco‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt know he had ever been a police officer. ‚ÄúWhat clothesline line‚Äôd ya steal that uniform from?‚Äù read one. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not from a clothesline. It‚Äôs rented!‚Äù</p>\n<p>I thought back to going to a federal police campus in Mexico City, where Marco told me he‚Äôd been ‚Äúnoticed‚Äù by one of the officers, who observed the particular way he jumped out of a van. A normal person ‚Äî me ‚Äî would exit facing forward. But Marco climbed out sideways, a reflex, he explained, from all his years carrying a long firearm. They‚Äôd spotted him and knew he was one of them.</p>\n<p>Had Marco invented that story? Was he not a police officer accused of corruption? I thought it over for a couple of days. But I decided it was better not to ask him. I didn‚Äôt think I would get a straight answer.</p>\n<p>On June 8, another source of radioactive material was stolen from a warehouse near Zumpango. This time it was a source that authorities considered less dangerous than the cobalt from the December heist. Police weren‚Äôt able to track it, but 10 days later it turned up in a garbage bag by a sewage canal. A security guard who spotted it believed the bag contained a body. Reports said it had sat by the canal untouched for several days, free for anyone to haul away.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3511328_4255809\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"623\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 575px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511328_4255809','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-31422-1415928715-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511328_4254612\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

Gates and Buffett gave the same one-word answer: ‚ÄúFocus.‚Äù (See more in¬†<em>The Snowball</em>¬†by Alice Schroeder).</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84367\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">I love the clarity of their answer but I am also concerned by how this can be, to quote Rudyard Kipling, ‚Äútwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.‚Äù I am an advocate for focus in work, life and leadership. However, the subject has a nuance and depth that many people miss. For a start, most people think of there only being one kind of focus.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a noun</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84368\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">When people speak of focus they usually mean having a single goal. It is a static thing, a thing you¬†<em>have</em>. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Roger Bannister relentlessly pursuing his goal of breaking the four-minute mile, John F. Kennedy challenging NASA to put a man on the moon within a decade or, coming back to Bill Gates, a vision of a personal computer on every desk. The upside to this kind of focus is clear and compelling: you pursue a single objective and don‚Äôt get distracted along the way; you build momentum as many different people aligned behind achieving this one goal.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84369\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">However, there is a dark side to focus as a noun. It‚Äôs what we might think of as the Kodak Problem. Kodak was relentlessly focused on a single objective‚Äîand it almost killed them. They found themselves caught off guard by the disruptive innovation of digital cameras. Kodak was so focused on optimizing for traditional film capture and processing that they did not see or accept the transformation in their industry. This is where the second type of focus comes in.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a verb</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84370\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focus is not just something you¬†<em>have</em>¬†it is also something you¬†<em>do</em>. This type of focus is not static; it is an intense, dynamic, ongoing, iterative process. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Steve Jobs saying to Jony Ive day after day, ‚ÄúThis might be crazy, but what if we‚Ä¶‚Äù until once in a while the idea took the air out of the room. It‚Äôs the constant exploration needed to see what is really going on and what the ‚Äúnoun focus‚Äù should be.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84371\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Imagine if the moment you woke up this morning your eyes focused one time and then never adjusted again. You would be out of focus all day. Our eyes produce clarity through a perpetual process of adjustment. Similarly, in our lives and on our teams, it is not enough to say, ‚ÄúWe have our focus!‚Äù Rather, and adapting Dwight D. Eisenhower statement, ‚ÄúFocus is nothing, focusing is everything.‚Äù That may take the point too far, but it still makes the point that having a focus is insufficient.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84372\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The downside to thinking of focus as a verb¬†only, is that it can lead to being overly reactive. It can lead people to making and remaking decisions too fast for any real momentum to take place. It can result in counterfeit agility where things feel fast but people aren‚Äôt going forward. It can become motion sickness instead of momentum.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84373\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The answer is to develop and value both types of focus. Professor Henry Mintzberg taught that there are two sources of strategy:</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Deliberate¬†strategy</strong>, where leaders develop a clear vision and map this to long, medium and short term goals (focus as a noun);</li>\n<li>\n<strong>emergent¬†strategy</strong>, where people respond to unanticipated problems and opportunities (focus as a verb).</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84374\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">It is the disciplined pursuit of both of these approaches that best enables us to focus on what is essential. We can plot this on a two by two to see what is at stake.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-231910\" src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/07/2.jpg?w=900&amp;h=551\" alt=\"2\" width=\"900\" height=\"551\"></p>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84375\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Here are three ways to combine both types of focus to ensure we getting the vital few things done.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84376\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Bill Gates said of Warren Buffett,<em>¬†‚Äú</em>I first met him‚Ä¶ at a dinner my mother had put together. On my way there, I thought, ‚ÄòWhy would I want to meet this guy who picks stocks?‚Äô I thought he just used various market-related things‚Äîlike volume, or how the price had changed over time‚Äîto make his decisions. But when we started talking that day, he didn‚Äôt ask me about any of those things. Instead he started asking big questions about the fundamentals of our business. ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt IBM do what Microsoft does? Why has Microsoft been so profitable?‚Äô That‚Äôs when I realized he thought about business in a much more profound way than I‚Äôd given him credit for.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"84377\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">In order to¬†have¬†focus we need to escape¬†to¬†focus.

By chance he had just completed his latest ‚ÄòThink Week.‚Äô Though I had heard about this practice, what I didn‚Äôt know was that it goes all the way back to the 1980s and that he stuck to it through the height of Micro- soft‚Äôs expansion. In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic time in the company‚Äôs history, he still created time and space to seclude himself for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112) and books, study technology, and think about the bigger picture. Today he still takes the time away from the daily distractions of running his foundation to simply think. Whether you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\n<h2>Know how valuable your time is</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84378\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">As Bill Gates has written,¬†‚ÄúNo matter how much money you have, you can‚Äôt buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone‚Äôs day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn‚Äôt let his calendar get filled up with useless meetings.

However, if we want to consistently give our energies to what is essential we need to develop¬†both¬†kinds of focus.

They should figure that a teeny bit more work on their part‚Äîto write smaller cheques‚Äîwill help them participate at the steepest part of the growth curve of new businesses.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126530\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Second, look to build real businesses that grow over the long term. Come with a Berkshire Hathaway mentality‚Äînot a Gordon Gecko built-to-Flipkart mindset. Also, why exit just because the company does? In firm after firm, their values have risen much more after an IPO, so why not stay in and capture the gains for your LPs years after the company goes public? A longer tenure allows you to do that.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126531\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Third, even with all this, look to make the companies grow faster‚Äînot by putting unreachable milestones or unnecessary funding in front of them‚Äîbut by helping them fill out their teams much earlier with good people.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126532\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">No good CXO tends to join a startup till its third year and second round of funding. So most startups waste a few years dawdling and gather speed only after year 3. Why not get a bunch of these folks working for the fund as a SWAT team of CXOs, and you could deploy them across your startups from day 1?

A longer term can help ride out up and down markets, can make next round funding even more viable‚Äîand also gets rid of the ‚Äútoo early to the market‚Äù problem.

As with many religions, complete unthinking devotion is required from its practitioners. Nothing in life is allowed to be more important than our children, and we must never speak a disloyal word about our relationships with our offspring. Children always come first. We accept this premise so reflexively today that we forget that it was not always so.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111218\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In our recently published book, <em><a href=\"http://diversionbooks.com/ebooks/sacred-cows-truth-about-divorce-and-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">Sacred Cows</a></em>, we took on our society‚Äôs nonsensical but deeply ingrained beliefs surrounding marriage and divorce. We often get asked whether we will next address the sacred cows of modern parenting, at which point we ask the speaker to please lower his voice, and we look nervously over our shoulders to make sure that nobody has overheard the question.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111219\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">To understand the frightening power of the parenthood religion, one need look no further than the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/fashion/27love.html\" target=\"_blank\">essay in The New York Times </a>by Ayelet Waldman, where the author explained that she loved her husband more than her four children.¬†On ‚ÄúOprah Where Are They Now,‚Äù the author recently reaffirmed the sentiments reflected in her New York Times article, and she added that her outlook has had a positive impact on her children by giving them a sense of security <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/own-where-are-they-now/Does-Ayelet-Waldman-Still-Love-Husband-More-Than-Children-Video\" target=\"_blank\">in their parents‚Äô relationship</a>. Following the publication of her essay, Waldman was not only shouted down by America for being a bad mother; strangers threatened her physically and told her that they would report her to child protective services. This is not how a civil society conducts open-minded discourse. This is how a religion persecutes a heretic.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\" style=\"display: none;\"><iframe id=\"537516121_hens\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111220\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">The origins of the parenthood religion are obscure, but one of its first manifestations may have been the ‚Äúbaby on board‚Äù placards that became <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703916004576271282489578512\" target=\"_blank\">popular in the mid-1980s</a>. Nobody would have placed such a sign on a car if it were not already understood by society that the life of a human achieves its peak value at birth and declines thereafter. A toddler is almost as precious as a baby, but a teenager less so, and by the time that baby turns fifty, it seems that nobody cares much anymore if someone crashes into her car. You don‚Äôt see a lot of vehicles with placards that read, ‚ÄúMiddle-aged accountant on board.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\n<h2>Read: <a href=\"http://qz.com/275987/you-probably-dont-know-the-real-story-behind-baby-on-board-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">You probably don‚Äôt know the real story behind Baby on Board signs</a>\n</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111221\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Another sign of the parenthood religion is that it has become totally unacceptable in our culture to say anything bad about our children, let alone admit that we don‚Äôt like them all of the time. We are allowed to say bad things about our spouses, our parents, our aunts and uncles, but try saying, ‚ÄúMy kid doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends because she‚Äôs not a super likable person,‚Äù and see how fast you get dropped from the PTA.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"111222\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">When people choose to have children, they play a lottery. Children have the same range of positive and negative characteristics as adults, and the personalities of some children are poorly matched with those of their parents. Nature has protected children against such a circumstance by endowing them with irresistible cuteness early on, and by ensuring that parents bond with children sufficiently strongly that our cave-dwelling ancestors didn‚Äôt push their offspring out in a snowbank when they misbehaved. Much as parents love their children and have their best interests at heart, however, they don‚Äôt always like them. That guy at the office who everyone thinks is a jerk was a kid once upon a time, and there‚Äôs a pretty good chance that his parents also noticed that he could be a jerk. They just weren‚Äôt allowed to say so.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111223\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Of course, Ayelet Waldman‚Äôs blasphemy was not admitting that her kids were less than completely wonderful, only that she loved her husband more than them. This falls into the category of thou-shalt-have-no-other-gods-before-me. As with many religious crimes, judgment is not applied evenly across the sexes. Mothers must devote themselves to their children above anyone or anything else, but many wives would be offended if their husbands said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty great, but my love for you will never hold a candle to the love I have for John Junior.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111224\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Mothers are also holy in a way that fathers are not expected to be. Mothers live in a clean, cheerful world filled with primary colors and children‚Äôs songs, and they don‚Äôt think about sex. A father could admit to desiring his wife without seeming like a distracted parent, but society is not as willing to cut Ms. Waldman that same slack. It is unseemly for a mother to enjoy pleasures that don‚Äôt involve her children.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111225\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">There are doubtless benefits that come from elevating parenthood to the status of a religion, but there are obvious pitfalls as well. Parents who do not feel free to express their feelings honestly are less likely to resolve problems at home. Children who are raised to believe that they are the center of the universe have a tough time when their special status erodes as they approach adulthood. Most troubling of all, couples who live entirely child-centric lives can lose touch with one another to the point where they have nothing left to say to one another when the kids leave home.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"4\" data-thread-id=\"111226\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In the 21st century, most Americans marry for love. We choose partners who we hope will be our soulmates for life. When children come along, we believe that we can press pause on the soulmate narrative, because parenthood has become our new priority and religion. We raise our children as best we can, and we know that we have succeeded if they leave us, going out into the world to find partners and have children of their own. Once our gods have left us, we try to pick up the pieces of our long neglected marriages and find new purpose. Is it surprising that divorce rates are rising fastest for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/fashion/weddings/divorce-after-50-grows-more-common.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">new empty nesters</a>?¬†Perhaps it is time that we gave the parenthood religion a second thought.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111227\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>We welcome your comments at <a href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\">ideas@qz.com</a>.

This is not by chance of course; a key part of the ‚ÄúLondon effect‚Äù is that city‚Äôs attraction to migrants and those aspiring to a better life.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\"><iframe id=\"537516121_3n2x\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126392\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">The best way to measure how a school, or a city-wide school system, fares is to look at pupil progress. This is what I do here, focusing on progress through secondary school. Progress is defined by comparing the GCSE points score to Key Stage 2 scores.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126393\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">What do we see? First, there is a London premium in pupil progress of just over eight GCSE grade points, where a grade point is the difference between A and B, or D and E. (For an international comparison this is 9.8% of a standard deviation). This is a huge number: the difference between say getting eight Cs rather than eight Ds.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126394\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">Ethnic composition matters a great deal. In fact, differences in composition account for all of the gap in the progress measure. If I assume that London had the same ethnic composition as the rest of England, then given the progress of each ethnic group in each place (London/not London), there would be no ‚ÄúLondon effect.‚Äù An easy way to see this is through a simple regression. Apply the ‚ÄúLondon effect‚Äù to all the pupils in all state schools in England, first not taking account of ethnicity and then adding those controls in, and this graph shows the effect is wiped out.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126395\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">There are two important cases where accounting for ethnicity halves the London premium but does not entirely eliminate it. If we consider GCSE points excluding¬†<a href=\"http://archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/page.aspx?o=131318\">the various vocational qualifications</a>, such as the GCSE in Applied Health and Social Care or the GCSE in Leisure and Tourism, there remains a small but significant London effect. This in turn arises because pupils in London enter for significantly fewer of these courses. The implications of this are unclear.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126396\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">It is certainly not appropriate to simply remove some subject scores from the total and claim that the remainder represents ‚Äútrue‚Äù progress. Nevertheless, the fact that London schools systematically entered pupils for less of these qualifications may represent the outcome of a particular policy.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126397\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">A measure of very high exam performance also yields a small but significant London effect. This may derive from the very high concentration of professional families in London and their high input into their children‚Äôs education (which is not captured by a socio-economic variable that just measures eligibility for free school meals).</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126398\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">Many school leaders, politicians and commentators enthuse about the success of a major policy of the time,¬†<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\">London Challenge</a>, and view it as¬†<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\">unambiguously improving schools in London</a>. This unanimity carries weight‚Äîand no doubt London schools have improved in a number of ways. But so far at least, catching a reflection of this improvement in the data is proving to be difficult.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126399\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">It sounds somehow uninspiring and disappointing that the London attainment premium is largely ‚Äúaccounted for by demographic composition‚Äù rather than wholly caused by a clever policy. I disagree. It can be seen as a story of aspiration and ambition. There is nothing inherently different about the ability of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds, but the children of immigrants typically have high aspirations and ambitions, and might place greater hopes in the education system.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<figure class=\"align-center\"></figure><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126400\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">There is a clear desire among commentators to hang on to the ‚ÄúLondon effect.‚Äù As noted above, this can be done by focusing on a subset of GCSE exams‚Äîvocational qualifications‚Äîand taking that as the outcome measure. But this is currently the only way that that belief can be supported.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126401\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">The main point is this: we are in serious danger of missing the big issue by focusing on this technical debate over vocational qualifications. In this headlong rush to hang on to the possible effects of a slightly mysterious policy, we are just skipping past a clear and demonstrable achievement of London.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126402\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">Sustaining a large, successful and reasonably integrated multi-ethnic school system containing pupils from every country in the world and speaking more than 300 languages is a great thing. To my mind, this is what we should be celebrating about the London education system.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126403\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\"><img style=\"width:0;height:0;\" src=\"http://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/34090/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"><em>This post originally appeared at¬†<a href=\"http://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-why-do-students-in-london-do-better-at-school-34090\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a>.

The gangly, boyish, and eminently charming actor, best known for playing Marius in 2012‚Äôs <i>Les Mis√©rables</i>, is meant to be seated on a plush couch in his inordinately posh Manhattan hotel suite, but he seems incapable of staying put. He frequently springs up to further demonstrate whatever point he‚Äôs in the middle of making, and even when he is seated, his deep, throaty voice races headlong out of him, his mouth often tripping over his words.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had spaghetti bolognese for lunch, which felt amazing at the time, and then I hit a wall,‚Äù he tells BuzzFeed News at the outset of his interview last month. ‚ÄúI have a vat of coffee here, which is propelling me back into form. So hopefully my chat will not stink.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Redmayne‚Äôs infectious verve is, ironically, in service of explaining how he learned to keep his body resolutely stiff and static. With the new film <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, the 32-year-old Redmayne has been winning the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonwillmore/benedict-cumberbatch-vs-eddie-redmayne\">best reviews</a> of his young career, as well as considerable Oscar buzz, for his performance as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who has famously spent the vast majority of his career in a wheelchair due to a physically debilitating motor neuron disease similar to ALS. (One typical rave, from <i><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20869525,00.html\">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>: ‚ÄúRedmayne‚Äôs astonishing transformation lends a touch of magic to the material.‚Äù)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255800\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 245px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255800','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Eddie Redmayne in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The film, which is currently playing in New York and Los Angeles and expands into more theaters on Nov. 14, tracks Hawking‚Äôs physical decline from his early days as a doctoral candidate at Cambridge. Its main emotional focus, however, is how the disease affected his romance with and eventual marriage to Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whose memoir served as the basis for the film. Playing Hawking proposed one of the most intimidating challenges imaginable for an actor: Faithfully portraying the physical specificity of Hawking‚Äôs disease meant bottling up virtually every tool available to capture his emotional inner life.</p>\n<p>But according to <i>The Theory of Everything</i>‚Äôs director, James Marsh (<i>Man on Wire</i>), it was a challenge that Redmayne was up to from the moment the two first met to discuss the role. ‚ÄúEddie‚Äôs a very intelligent actor,‚Äù Marsh says a few weeks later on the phone. ‚ÄúI was struck by how much he understood the nature of the psychology of the role, and what he had to do is to physically prepare for what then would become an emotional performance. The physicality needed to be in place and embedded, essentially, into his preparation. Once that was in place, then the real work began to bring this character to life emotionally. He understood all that from the get-go.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255075\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"661\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 613px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255075','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by David J.

(Instead, he studied the history of art at Cambridge.) ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wondered if at drama school you get given [a] process,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEvery single job I do, whether it‚Äôs theater or film, I‚Äôm still grappling to find a process. But interestingly, when I got cast in [<i>Theory of Everything</i>], my instinct was to make it quite a formal one.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Part of that instinct stemmed from his understanding that the practical demands of film production ‚Äî shooting the film out of sequence ‚Äî would add yet another layer of complication to the job of capturing Hawking‚Äôs physical deterioration. ‚ÄúI had to absolutely map what his physical decline was going to be,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI wanted to do that with a dancer. ‚Ä¶ Quite particularly on film, people are a bit scared to ask actors to do [a scene] again. But with dancers, they‚Äôre extraordinary artists, and it‚Äôs like‚Äù ‚Äî he began clapping his hands ‚Äî ‚Äú<i>do it again, do it again, do it again</i> until you get it right. That was the rigor in which I wanted to work ‚Äî not to compromise. ‚Ä¶ For Stephen, the disease couldn‚Äôt be less important. Like, he has <i>no</i> interest in it,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúI wanted to make sure that this is not a story of a disease. It‚Äôs an unconventional love story. I wanted to be totally free of thinking about what my little finger‚Äôs doing to play whatever the emotion was.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255816\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"661\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 613px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255816','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr02/longform-14026-1415928784-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>To get to that immersive place, Redmayne ‚Äî as well as his co-star Jones, who also had to discover how best to play a living person ‚Äî had to become something of a detective mixed with an investigative reporter mixed with a movement artist. ‚ÄúIn some ways, it‚Äôs being like Sherlock Holmes,‚Äù says Jones, sitting in her own nearby hotel suite. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trying to interrogate who this person is and then inhabit them in a truthful way.‚Äù After teaming up with dancer-choreographer Alexandra Reynolds (who also worked on <i>World War Z</i>), Redmayne met with doctors, nurses, and patients at the Queen Square Centre for Neuromuscular Disease in London. ‚ÄúThey have an ALS clinic every week, and at the end [the doctor] would say, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs an actor here trying to play Stephen Hawking, would you be interested in meeting him?‚Äô‚Äù says Redmayne. ‚ÄúAnd across the board, people were sensationally generous. ‚Ä¶ Some people would allow me to feel their hands, to feel the weight of their bodies.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the clinic, Redmayne also learned about the differences between the loss of ‚Äúupper‚Äù neurons ‚Äî which causes the affected areas to fix into a rigid shape ‚Äî and ‚Äúlower‚Äù neurons ‚Äî which causes the opposite, the body to go loose and limp. But those losses are specific to each person, which meant Redmayne had to sort out ‚Äî based mostly on archival photos and whatever he could find on YouTube ‚Äî how Hawking‚Äôs motor neuron disease uniquely manifested itself, and when. He then showed those images to the doctors at Queen Square so they could render a loose sort of diagnosis.</p>\n<p>After filling an iPad with every scrap of visual and documentary material he collected, Redmayne then created a single, double-sided master list, which charted out the details he‚Äôd need to know for every single scene. That list, he says, included ‚Äúwhat muscles had gone, where vocally he was at, and then what glasses he was wearing, whether he was on one stick or two sticks, or which wheelchair he was in.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255833\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2_preview.gif\" width=\"440\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Transformation of Eddie Redmayne\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_enhanced-mid-32268-1415928937-2.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Throughout this process, Redmayne was also working with Reynolds, three days a week, three to four hours a day, in a rehearsal space, to teach his body how to render each stage of Hawking‚Äôs decline. ‚ÄúRather than just replicating positions, it was about when you‚Äôre <i>holding</i> these positions,‚Äù Redmayne says, as he starts to shrug up his shoulders, and twist and stiffen his hands. ‚ÄúIt was almost like internally learning to squash my body, or to be able to manipulate [my] hands in ways that it hadn‚Äôt done before.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One of the trickier elements was mastering an early stage of ALS-related diseases, a phenomenon called ‚Äúdropped foot,‚Äù where the patient‚Äôs foot essentially goes limp at the ankle.

For that, he relied especially on Marsh and Jones. <i>The Theory of Everything</i> spends just as much time exploring Jane Hawking‚Äôs life as it does Stephen‚Äôs, and how all-consuming it became for her to care for her husband. ‚ÄúI remember being in a rehearsal room with Eddie, and Eddie‚Äôs in the chair, and then suddenly you feel as the person playing the carer you have this enormous responsibility,‚Äù Jones says. ‚ÄúAt a certain point, Stephen couldn‚Äôt just lift up a spoon. So Jane‚Äôs got to be there doing it for him. So suddenly, I was like, <i>Gosh, I‚Äôve got to be the responsible one in this situation!</i> She was Stephen‚Äôs movement in the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Indeed, the circumstances of their characters put a great deal of literal and figurative weight on Jones‚Äô shoulders. ‚ÄúNormally, when you arrive on a film set each morning, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to shoot the scene here,‚Äô‚Äù says Redmayne. ‚ÄúJames will have an opinion. Then maybe Felicity will say, ‚ÄòActually, maybe I‚Äôll try it in this seat.‚Äô You‚Äôre playing with ideas. But virtually every single day on this, I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt move from here.‚Äô She has to do all the heavy lifting ‚Äî a lot of it, as far as keeping the energy in scenes. It was really complicated.

Big, blank, and imaginary; it was perfect. A boy‚Äôs world of dominoed dunes and empty spaces that stretched and shimmered across the pages my mother read to me every evening in our Nebraska apartment.</p>\n<p>My father had just left, and I was having trouble sleeping. My baby brother didn‚Äôt seem bothered. But I was a couple years older and more easily frightened. During the day I rarely spoke or cried, but at night I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. My mom must have been struggling too, because at some point during that ugly stretch reading became our thing. There had always been bedtime stories, but this was something different. This was a mother‚Äôs magic trick, the borrowing of alternate worlds to escape our own.</p>\n<p>We started with Bible stories, bearded patriarchs and long robes, before working our way through the public library‚Äôs collection of <i>The Black Stallion</i> books. I adored Alec, the redheaded hero of the series, almost as much as I loved the Black, the wild Arabian stallion at its center. The pair appealed to me because they were me, or at least the me I wanted to be. Alec was young and independent, free from parental interference, and the Black was big and loyal, just like my own horse.</p>\n<p>After the divorce, my mother had fixated on the animal, stubbornly refusing to sell our one luxury. Molly wasn‚Äôt black or a stallion, but my mind was already learning to skip past the awkward inconsistencies of life. I didn‚Äôt know Palomino or mare. But I knew horse. And that‚Äôs what I had. Sitting on Molly wearing a plastic cowboy hat, I spent my days playing through the stories we read at night. One minute I was Alec racing the Black through Arabia, the next I was Jedediah Smith crossing the Mojave. Already I was learning the dangers of the desert. Smith, my mother would read one night, died on the Santa Fe Trail full of Comanche arrows. Another night, Alec got trampled. Slowly, as the stories began to accumulate, tragedy seeped into play. ‚ÄúSorry, Molly,‚Äù I would whisper toward the end of our sessions, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre lost and I have to eat you.‚Äù Patting her neck, I tried to ease the sting of my words. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll survive.‚Äù</p>\n<p>As our reading times expanded, so too did my imagination. What started as a desperate attempt to get a scared little boy to sleep had grown into a ritualized treat: reading time with mom. The comfort of her voice gave way to the rhythm of the story, as I went from not knowing the shapes of letters to sounding out words. Only later, when I started to go off on my own, reading large chunks while she was away at work, did things change. For a while we had two sets of books: ours and mine. But that didn‚Äôt last either. I read too much, too fast. And as my stack of library books dwindled, I tended to steal from our shared pile. My tastes changed as well, moving out from the half-shelves around the library checkout counter to Hardy Boys mysteries and western biographies deeper in the stacks. But I never left the desert, not really.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264317\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1100\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1417px; top: 1052px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264317','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>First it was Cairo, on a semester abroad program during my junior year. Then it was the Peace Corps in Jordan after graduation. That was the beginning, a decade in which I spent much of my time living in the Middle East. It was also the decade of 9/11 and a pair of massive wars.</p>\n<p>Cairo was exotic but crowded and Jordan‚Äôs eastern desert was drab and dreary, more volcanic rock than sand. But Yemen was different. Vibrant and stark, it felt like the underside of a rainbow. Sanaa had character and a wild, intoxicating charm. Politics, even at the top, was real and contested. Ali Abdullah Salih, a rough-talking president with a whiskey habit, had been in charge since before I was born, but even he was constrained. Tribes mattered more than parties, and alliances were always in flux. For a year, I spent my mornings reading Arab histories and my afternoons parsing rumors in sweaty little rooms where the smoke floated in layers. I was 24 years old and I was hooked.</p>\n<p>A trio of guards and doormen were my guides that first year. They taught me how to chew qat, rubbing and polishing the leaves, and welcomed me into their circle. We went shooting together in the desert, and opened up to each other in the awkward, fumbling manner of boys learning to become men.</p>\n<p>One day, Shaqib confessed this was how he imagined heaven: the four of us sitting around chewing qat, laughing and joking. ‚ÄúParadise,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúis the best of this world.‚Äù And that year the best of our world took place in a cramped little guard shack with crumbling walls off al-Bawniya Street. Outside everything was a mess with horrifying pictures from Abu Ghraib and Saddam in a spider hole. But inside there was the gentle grace of centuries and the human warmth and dignity that in Yemen could transcend everything else. Politics was one thing; personal interactions were something else.</p>\n<p>Most evenings, after qat, I slipped off on my own for a quiet walk. I usually turned right toward Zubayri Street and my favorite bookshop, dusty and disorderly, before reversing course for Sanaa‚Äôs old city and a glass of milky tea. History lived near the surface on those walks. I passed a bombed-out palace from Yemen‚Äôs last revolution in 1962 and, a bit further on, a paved-over square where the imam used to behead dissidents with a single stroke from a sword called ‚ÄúThe Purifier.‚Äù The palace had been converted into a secret prison, and teenagers played soccer all night in the square. But the past was still there if you knew where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264376\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264376\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264376\"}}' rel:description=\"For the first time I felt physically unsafe.

In late 2012, after the Arab Spring and the uprisings that forced Salih to step down, I scheduled another quick trip. I had lived through the revolution in Cairo, and had seen the expectations of change and a better life inflate and then burst leaving everyone more confused than ever. Yemen had changed as well. No one seemed to know the rules anymore. Salih was out and security was evaporating. There was a mad scramble for power that fall, and for the first time I felt physically unsafe. It was just a feeling, impossible to quantify, but I couldn‚Äôt shake it.</p>\n<p>Yemeni friends on Twitter and Facebook disagreed with my assessment, claiming I had lost my feel for the country. And maybe I had. What did I know about predicting violence? But I wasn‚Äôt alone. Among the small group of Yemen watchers, the numbers had started to lose their meaning with repetition: 40% chance of bombing, 60% chance of being kidnapped. They were guesses without an anchor. No one knew anything for certain. Western embassies issued travel warnings, but they were as vague as everything else. Yemen was bad ‚Äî maybe not Iraq bad ‚Äî but the speculation kept getting worse.</p>\n<p>Still, earlier this spring I decided to go back one more time. I pitched it to my editors as a three-story trip. But in my mind, it was a final farewell. I was getting married in a few months, and I wanted to move on and write about other things. I‚Äôd quit smoking years earlier and my twenties had slipped into my thirties. I was ready for a change. On March 6, I boarded the plane for my last trip to Yemen.</p>\n<p>Sixteen days later I was done. I had my three stories, or at least the notes and interviews to write them. But I didn‚Äôt want to leave, not yet. Something was still missing. Instead of flying home early, I compromised: One more story.</p>\n<p>I already knew the one I‚Äôd do. The ghost story every writer has, the one they obsess over and worry about; always researching, never writing. Mine was a tragedy that started with a Guantanamo interrogation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Detainee: I am from Urday City in Yemen, not a city in al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ My city is very far from the city of al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ That is not my name and I am not from that city‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: al-Qaeda is not a city. It is the name of an organization.</p>\n<p>Detainee: Whether it is a city or an organization, I am not from al-Qaeda. I am from Urday City.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Are you from Yemen?</p>\n<p>Detainee: Yes, I am from Urday.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you travel from Yemen to Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I went from Yemen to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you do that in the year 2000?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I don‚Äôt know the time.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Was it the year 1421?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I am from a village, I cannot tell time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The detainee, Adnan Abd al-Latif, was a mentally unstable man who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a car crash in 1994. Twice he had been cleared for release, but each time something went wrong and he remained locked in his cell, counting the days until there was nothing left to count. On Sept. 10, 2012, he committed suicide. He had been in Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs case seemed to get at all the horrors of that lost decade: a handicapped man who confused al-Qaeda with a Yemeni village of the same name, locked up as the worst of the worst. For 10 years, while Latif befriended the iguanas and banana rats that wandered into his cell, the U.S. and Yemen fought for custody. Neither side would give in. The U.S. had him but wouldn‚Äôt let him go; Yemen wanted him but couldn‚Äôt get him.</p>\n<p>Then Latif killed himself with a fistful of pills and positions changed. Now neither country wanted him. The U.S. needed him gone, but Yemen wouldn‚Äôt take him. In death, just as in life, he was in legal limbo ‚Äî neither here nor there. Instead of Guantanamo, Latif was sent to Germany, where his body was frozen and stored at Ramstein Air Base while the two countries argued over who had to take the corpse.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs story was sad, but mostly it was just human. He wasn‚Äôt nameless or faceless, an abstract stand-in for our fears. He was a man with a history and a family, and I wanted to write about them, to tell his story. In my mind it was less about Guantanamo Bay than it was about the withering of hope and how a single man had been ground down to nothing by a pair of bureaucracies. But no one else seemed to see it this way. Obama had already ordered the prison closed. He just hadn‚Äôt succeeded. Guantanamo was still open, and indefinite detention was still the law of the land. But the country had moved on; a collective forgetting that let us pretend everything had changed when nothing had.</p>\n<p>Before I left the U.S. I had reached out to one of the Guantanamo lawyers and he gave me the name of Latif‚Äôs brother in Yemen. Muhammad lived in Taizz, four hours south of Sanaa. But Yemen was still coming apart, and the roads were too dangerous for a drive. I asked Muhammed if he would fly to Sanaa for an interview.</p>\n<p>Since arriving in Sanaa I had been working with Shuaib, a young fixer and friend, who knew how to get things done in a country where nothing worked. That morning I met him at the ticket office to buy Muhammad‚Äôs plane ticket. The money I had just collected from Western Union went from me to Shuaib to the man behind the counter. I signed the receipt, the man behind the counter stamped it, and Shuaib called Taizz to confirm that Muhammad was on his way to the airport. It was just after 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 22. Muhammad‚Äôs flight landed in three hours, and Shuaib wanted breakfast.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the ticket office, Zubayri Street had been quiet. In another hour the shadows would be gone and the street would be noisy and hot with four jumbled lanes of traffic. But for the moment it was neither. Caught between the two, Zubayri Street came to life in fits and starts. Shuaib moved through it quickly, claiming he could smell something good. I smelled diesel and cigarettes. After a block whatever scent he was tracking had disappeared, and he gave up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go in here,‚Äù he said. The restaurant looked like every other one on the street: an open front with a roll-up shutter, a counter in the front, kitchen in the back, and long metal tables in between. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. But I didn‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôd already had breakfast; I just wanted another cup of coffee. ‚ÄúThis is fine.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Stepping up onto the sidewalk, Shuaib bumped into a soldier who was coming out of the restaurant, catching his windbreaker on the man‚Äôs rifle. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he mumbled, as he reached over to untangle his jacket. The man just looked at him, taking in Shuaib‚Äôs youth and his slight frame. And then he saw me. I was used to it, the attention and the double takes. Yemenis tend to stare at obvious foreigners, observing them as if they were under glass. But this time the lack of words was disconcerting. We were in the man‚Äôs space, inches from his face with Shuaib‚Äôs jacket hooked on his rifle. The whole thing was too intimate for silence. But the man in the olive green uniform didn‚Äôt say a word. Only his eyes moved, following Shuaib‚Äôs fingers as they slid up the barrel of his gun. Then we were free and moving again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_right_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264382\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:description=\"It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3513705_4264382\" rel:via=\"gregorydjohnsen\" rel:sub_title=\"It%20was%20nothing%20and%20he%20was%20no%20one,%20a%20soldier%20with%20a%\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:14\" rel:count=\"4\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitter'; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #004F9E; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That was it, a few seconds on the street before breakfast.

I saw him as soon as we left the restaurant: Ten yards up the road next to another man in a military uniform. Both of them were young, and both had guns.</p>\n<p>The first man, the one Shuaib had bumped into, crossed the space between us surprisingly quickly and grabbed his arm. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù he asked in rough Arabic, with a gesture toward me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my friend,‚Äù Shuaib replied.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIs he a foreigner?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Shuaib said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an American researcher.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the man said, pulling Shuaib toward the street. ‚ÄúCome to the base with us.

Grabbing my arm, he started pulling me toward the street. My eyes followed my body and I saw the yellow-and-white taxi: driver inside, back door open. And then I knew.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264321\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"764\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 716px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264321','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I had played through this scenario dozens of times.

In my heart or out loud, in Arabic or English, I don‚Äôt know. But I said it: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting into that cab.‚Äù Then I jerked my arm back. The man pulled harder, and we were scuffling. There was no punching or screaming, none of the things I would have imagined, just a weird one-armed tug-of-war over a few yards of asphalt. I was older and stronger, but he had a gun. His hand, dry and cracked, slipped down past my wrist, catching on the backpack that I had slung over one arm. For a second, I thought about dropping the backpack and running. But it had the rest of the $600 I‚Äôd pulled out of Western Union, my passport, and all my notebooks from two weeks of work. I tugged.</p>\n<p>Several Yemenis had gathered around us in a loose half-circle. I had always assumed that if something went really wrong, some Yemeni would step up to save me. That had been my insurance policy as I moved through a society that was not my own. But now I was being taken and they were just watching.</p>\n<p>In our world, evil typically wears a mask. It stalks about in disguise, peeking out through the cracks in our humanity. We rarely see it or recognize it when we do, but on that morning in Sanaa it was unmistakable. Dropping Shuaib‚Äôs arm, the man grabbed for his gun. That‚Äôs when I thought he would start shooting. Shuaib moved fast, escaping up the street and scrambling for cover. The second man let go of my backpack to chamber his own bullet, and then I was running too.</p>\n<p>I remembered to zigzag as I ducked into a different restaurant and headed for the back. My plan was to run through the kitchen and escape out the back and then make a big loop back to the American Institute, where I was staying. I made it to the rear of the restaurant, but as I tried to go through the kitchen, one of the Yemeni workers blocked me.</p>\n<p><i>‚ÄúMamnu‚Äòa,‚Äù</i> he said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúForbidden,‚Äù I panted back dumbly. He just stared at me and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> a second time.</p>\n<p>I was trapped. The restaurant was laid out like a giant L, one long main room with a right-angled nook for a sink. I was around the corner by the sink, only a few feet from the door to the kitchen and the way out. But I could no longer see the street and I started to panic. I had to move, to get out of the restaurant. Any second, the men were going to come around the corner. In my mind, I saw the German diplomat lying dead on the grocery store tile.</p>\n<p>I tried to get through the kitchen door a second time, but another employee wrapped me in a giant bear hug and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> yet again. I had no more moves. There was nothing left to react against. Shaking as fear crashed over adrenaline, I tried to think. I needed a plan and I didn‚Äôt have one.</p>\n<p>Fumbling with my backpack, I found my phone and called a contact at the U.S. Embassy. Earlier that week I‚Äôd met him for lunch, seen his guard detail, and ridden in the armored SUV. Maybe he could come to the restaurant and escort me out. But no one picked up. I dialed a second number; still nothing.</p>\n<p>Waiters were still moving back and forth with food and people were eating. But I was stuck, cowering in a corner waiting for whatever came next. A couple of Yemenis came over to tell me that the men were gone, but I didn‚Äôt believe them. Then, someone walked over with a metal cup of water in his hand.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre under my protection.</p>\n<p>I wanted to laugh. He had a cup; the men outside had guns. I explained that they were trying to kidnap me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a foreigner?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúSyrian?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm American.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù he shrugged, and walked away. After that, no one else approached me.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Shuaib came around the corner. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù he said. But my heart was still pounding, and I no longer trusted Yemen or my instincts. I didn‚Äôt move. The corner had become safe.</p>\n<p>Shuaib left and came back. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really gone.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p>\n<p>We grabbed a cab in front of the Chinese Embassy, while Shuaib called the police and I gave the driver directions. ‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt real soldiers,‚Äù Shuaib told me with the phone pressed up against his ear. I held my bag as he told the driver to go the wrong way up a one-way street. Two minutes later we were in front of the American Institute.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStay inside,‚Äù Shuaib implored. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I called the embassy and reported the incident. I told the director and I emailed Asha. Then the electricity went out and there were no more distractions. I imagined Shuaib hit in the head and dumped out of the car. I would be taken to some house for a few days and then smuggled past the checkpoints around Sanaa. After that I‚Äôd be gone. It had happened before, and it would happen again. Sitting alone in my room on a sunny Saturday morning in Sanaa, I felt my fear grow wild and unchained like a beast come back to life. It was the fear of a little boy who didn‚Äôt understand the world or what was happening around him.</p>\n<p>Getting out of the room suddenly seemed very important. I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but it was lunchtime. Time to go. I paused in the courtyard, taking in the walls that kept the rest of Yemen out. They were mud-brick and thick, comforting but debilitating. If I didn‚Äôt go now, I never would. I thought about Molly and my mother‚Äôs voice trying to make me tough for the world to come. ‚ÄúGet back on,‚Äù she‚Äôd say each time I got bucked off. There were no hugs or comfort in those moments, just the cold insistence of a woman who knew how hard life could be. I walked out the door.</p>\n<p>On the surface, the city looked the same, drab beige buildings and the crowded market where I had bought my qat a decade earlier, but it was no longer a place I knew. The bookstore on Zubayri Street was gone, swallowed up by time, and the country was changing as well. The familiar had become foreign. What thrilled me in my twenties frightened me in my thirties. I played with my food until someone asked if I was an American.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264324\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"176\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 128px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264324','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Muhammad wouldn‚Äôt come in when I opened the institute gate for him and Shuaib later that afternoon.

Eventually I realized that he was just trying to make a rhetorical point, showing me what had happened to his brother and how he ended up in Guantanamo, but by then I was too far gone to care. It felt good to unload on him, to scream and rant and finally react to the morning. In that moment, I hated him and his country. He was mad about what happened to his brother, and I was mad about what happened to me. But I wasn‚Äôt the one who had forced his brother into suicide, and he wasn‚Äôt the one who had tried to kidnap me.

I was finishing up my first story and I needed an interview. I‚Äôd already talked to his dad and brother on my trip, but it turned out that he had more information than anyone else and that he lived in Brooklyn. I suggested dinner at the Yemen Caf√© on Atlantic.</p>\n<p>I got there early and for a few minutes I just sat and listened to the chatter around me. English and Arabic, familiar and foreign, Brooklyn and Yemen. Everything was so mixed up and messy. The restaurant was different but the same. I couldn‚Äôt separate any of it.</p>\n<p>When I looked up Fahd was coming through the door with two other Yemenis. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned friends, but I didn‚Äôt want to seem like a jerk so I told them to sit down. BuzzFeed would cover the meal. They wanted to hear about my trip and what I thought of Yemen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very bad.‚Äù They just nodded at what they already knew and ordered for me.</p>\n<p>The restaurant was too crowded and noisy for an interview, and one of the men suggested we talk across the street in his shop. The bill had already been paid. But as soon as he pulled down the metal shutters blocking out the light and traffic from Atlantic, I knew it was a mistake. I was in Brooklyn, seven blocks from my apartment, but my body was back in Yemen, locked in a dark room with three Yemeni men. On the audio recording of the interview my voice sounds calm. I make a joke and everyone laughs, but I could feel the truth inside: jittery, full of fear, and looking for a way out.</p>\n<p>For a moment I wondered if I was going mad, then I thought about PTSD. Is that why I was shaking?</p>\n<p>Outside, Brooklyn was chilly and calm, American. I walked Fahd and his friends to the corner and thanked them for dinner. They had been gracious and hospitable, Yemeni. Three distant echoes of the country I once knew.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. For a while I tried to read, but stories had lost their magic. There were no other worlds, only this one. And in it I did the only thing I could. I cried, facedown and helpless, on a pillow where no one could hear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4267370\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Sign up for our BuzzReads email, and you‚Äôll get our best feature stories every Sunday ‚Äî plus other great stories from around the web!</h2>\n\n\n <div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n  \n   \n     <p>\n</p>\n<form rel:gt_cat=\"[ttp]:content\" action=\"http://buzzfeed.createsend.com/t/t/s/jiuhhh/\" method=\"post\">\n<input rel:gt_act=\"input\" id=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-jiuhhh-jiuhhh\" type=\"text\" style=\"font-size:12pt; height:24px; width: 75%\" placeholder=\" your email address\" required=\"\">\n<br><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<input rel:gt_act=\"sign-up\" type=\"submit\" class=\"button2\" value=\"Sign Me Up!\" name=\"submitNewsletter\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"0\">\n</p>\n</form>\n   \n  \n </div>\n\n <p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://embed.contagiousmedia.com/embed/sub/sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq?uri=sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq&amp;cb=1416223871\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this embed ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 11:46:38.540323"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/gregorydjohnsen/how-i-escaped-a-kidnapping-attempt-in-yemen"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/15/12/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14186-1416070878-3.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-16"], ["title", "My Last Day In¬†Yemen"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 11:46:38.540323"]]

The story, she wrote to BuzzFeed News, ‚Äúdumbfounded‚Äù her: It mentioned former students facing mountains of debt for their degrees, but that didn‚Äôt seem to apply to her. Brown believed that she was ‚Äúon a 100% Pell Grant through the government‚Äù and didn‚Äôt owe a cent.</p>\n<p>Everest even paid for her books and her laptop, she wrote, and sent her a stipend check every semester. ‚ÄúWill I have to pay this back or am I one of the few students being treated genuinely by Everest University?‚Äù she asked.</p>\n<p>In reality, most of what Brown believed to be a Pell Grant was actually loans: A review of documents she provided showed she owes more than $26,000.</p>\n<p>Brown, 29, who lives in Kentucky and enrolled at Everest in 2011, has yet to learn that she is going into debt for her degree. (Her last name has been changed because she is a current student.) She no longer has a phone because she is unable to pay the bills, and she sent her student loan documents from a computer at a nearby food bank where she accesses the internet. She has since been hospitalized, unreachable by phone or email.</p>\n<p>Like thousands of other students, Brown has fallen victim to a predatory lender that exploits the aspirations of the poor and disadvantaged. She had good reason to trust Everest Colleges and Universities and its representatives: It is a nationally accredited college, plugged into the government-backed student loan system that pays for the education of millions of students each year. But for thousands of desperate and financially unsophisticated students at Everest, that trust was deeply misplaced.</p>\n<p>Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs publicly traded parent company, is facing a slew of lawsuits and investigations alleging it falsified job records and misrepresented itself to students. The company is effectively being shut down by the federal government; by early next year, it will no longer own any colleges.</p>\n<p>Since July, I have heard from more than 150 current and former students who reached out to me through email, phone, text message, and Facebook after <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/this-new-lawsuit-against-everest-college-explains-why-the-go\">a story about Everest I wrote in April</a> began circulating widely among former students. The vast majority I spoke to were poor women, many of them minorities, who said they were lured to enroll with promises of jobs and good wages that would support their families. They told me they had taken out tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without understanding the extent of their debt, and sometimes not even knowing they were in debt at all. The tactics that admissions officers had used to convince them to enroll, they said, were manipulative and unethical; lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186974\">allege they were illegal</a>.</p>\n<p>By the end of their programs, students owed as much as $50,000, and few believe they will ever be able to repay even a fraction of it. Most said they graduated without jobs, then returned to unemployment or low-paying work in fast-food or retail. They used words like ‚Äúbetrayed,‚Äù ‚Äúlied to,‚Äù and ‚Äúvictimized.‚Äù Many begged for help.</p>\n<p>Corinthian, Everest‚Äôs parent company, has routinely denied most of the allegations in the many lawsuits against the company. Its spokesperson, Kent Jenkins, said that Corinthian has found employment for the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of its tens of thousands of graduates, and that the school regularly provided students with ‚Äúclear and accurate‚Äù information about the cost of their educations and the ability of credits to transfer. He denied that admissions representatives used aggressive or unethical tactics to coerce students into enrolling. Corinthian‚Äôs accreditation and job placement standards, he said, are far more stringent than those at community colleges offering similar programs.</p>\n<p>Corinthian is being sued by the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357655-cfpb-complaint-2014.html\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> and attorneys general in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/\">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html\">Wisconsin</a>, and faces investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and six more states, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corinthian-colleges-20140814-story.html\">criminal probe in California</a>. Earlier this year, the Department of Education reached an <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/the-government-is-finally-forcing-a-major-for-profit-college\">unprecedented agreement</a> to essentially shut down Corinthian, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>But for more than half a million current and former students, neither the shutdown nor the many lawsuits really matter. They will likely see little to no debt relief on their federal loans. They will see none of the jobs they believe they were promised. And while the company may be closing its doors, 85 of Everest‚Äôs campuses aren‚Äôt: They will be sold off, likely to other for-profit college operators or to private equity investors, and will continue to recruit and enroll students.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254424\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"386\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 338px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254424','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The administration office entrance at Everest College in Santa Ana, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>At every step of the way, people fell prey to Everest precisely because of tactics designed to capitalize on their poverty and their trust in an accredited university.

Students spoke of receiving phone calls daily, even four or five times a day. The calls didn‚Äôt end until they agreed to speak at length with an admissions representative, by phone or on campus.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives are salespeople ‚Äî the jobs are advertised as such by Corinthian, according to the California lawsuit. What they sell, though, is something much bigger than a college education, or even the promises of job placement services and $12 hourly salaries. They sell prospective students a future that many of them never imagined was possible.</p>\n<p>Students told me they felt they had no choice but to enroll. Not to do so, they said, seemed like turning down a guarantee at a better life for themselves and their families. ‚ÄúThey put on a great act saying how many jobs were available and how good I was gonna get paid,‚Äù Cacha Cherry, who graduated from Everest in 2010, wrote in an email about the first day she visited an Everest campus. ‚ÄúThey told me about people who had gotten a job and had wonderful careers and great lives ‚Äî how they were able to buy homes, go on vacations, and live this wonderful life.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Cherry had no intention of enrolling that day, but the representatives prepared papers for her to sign, despite her protests. ‚ÄúI felt pressured to sign because I wanted to make a good living for my child ‚Äî I was a young mother trying to make a better life for both of us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>A former admissions representative at Everest, one of five with whom I communicated, said Everest taught a sales tactic her supervisors called ‚Äúpeeling the onion,‚Äù appealing to students‚Äô emotions by asking them leading questions that focused on their hopes and dreams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHow do you think this degree will change your daughter‚Äôs life?‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow meaningful would being the first person in your family to graduate from college be?‚Äô It was all about the emotional side.‚Äù She called the enrollment tactics she was taught ‚Äúbeyond deceptive and immoral, given the circumstances of the prospective students.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives were under heavy pressure to sign up students ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358002-2013-10k-2.html#document/p30/a186771\">until recently, they were paid based</a> in large part on how many students they enrolled, a practice that was made legal under a series of ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù laws passed by the Bush administration in 2002. Those rules were repealed by the Obama administration in 2011, but four former admissions representatives told me that their job performance was evaluated based in part on enrollment numbers.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to hit certain enrollment numbers or risk our jobs,‚Äù said another former admissions representative, who asked not to be named because his current employer is also a for-profit college. ‚ÄúSo plenty of students were enrolled that weren‚Äôt supposed to be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins denied this. Company-wide evaluation standards, the company spokesperson said, ‚Äúdo not include the number of students [admissions representatives] enroll.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Former students said Everest‚Äôs admissions office also used tactics more akin to those found in high-pressure sales environments. Many students who visited Everest‚Äôs campus for tours or simply to pick up brochures said they found themselves ushered into the enrollment and financial aid offices, bombarded by promises about job placement and encouraged to make a choice to better their futures. To get them to enroll immediately, Everest representatives often told students that they risked losing their spot in the school or that the semester was about to begin without them,‚Äù suggesting they may have to wait months or even a year before the next chance to enroll</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was considered a failure if we didn‚Äôt enroll by the end of the day‚Äù of their first visit, said the former admissions representative. Two other former admissions officers made similar assertions. If students seemed hesitant to enroll on their first visit, one representative said, administrators ‚Äúwould meet with them personally‚Äù before they left campus.</p>\n<p>Students said that as a result of the rushed, single-day process, they were given little time to read the documents they were signing. They instead trusted the word of the admissions representative who explained the documents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI remember feeling extremely overwhelmed and confused about what was happening, and by the end of the conversation, I‚Äôd basically signed up for the school and was beginning classes,‚Äù said LaShayna Bell, of Tempe, Arizona, who enrolled in 2010. ‚ÄúIt was like I blinked and missed what I‚Äôd done.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that it is ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù for a student to enroll on the first visit, but would not specify whether that included signing preliminary paperwork. ‚ÄúWe encourage students to take their time and consider it carefully,‚Äù Jenkins said. ‚ÄúWe encourage prospective students to bring a family member or close friend on the first visit, and to ask questions about all aspects of the program.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That family member, however, sometimes turned into another opportunity for the company. Interviews with admissions representatives and former students show that Everest‚Äôs tactics were so aggressive that the school sometimes also enrolled the mothers, sisters, and spouses who accompanied prospective students on campus visits.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254607\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"835\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 787px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254607','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The vast majority of Everest‚Äôs students have no prior experience with college ‚Äî few relatives who attended themselves or high school counselors to help navigate the process. Sintia Lopez, a veteran, emigrated from Nicaragua when she was 12, unable to speak a word of English; she knew nobody who had ever gone to college. She believed her Everest representative when she was told that the school was one of the best in Florida, and believed the representative‚Äôs claim that the high tuition was a sign of quality education that she wouldn‚Äôt get at a community college. She didn‚Äôt know that it was abnormal for a school to call you at all hours of the day, begging you to enroll.</p>\n<p>Admissions representatives enrolled many students who were unlikely, or even unable, to succeed in college: Among those I spoke with, more than a dozen did not have a GED, including an eighth-grade dropout who was enrolled in an accounting program. Several were violent felons who could not legally be employed in the health care industry or criminal justice jobs offered by their programs.</p>\n<p>Many more appeared to be only semi-literate and were unprepared to handle college-level work. One student, who had completed a medical assistant program months after being released from jail on a felony assault charge, wrote to me: ‚ÄúI need getting loans with cleared cause I had just got out of prison and I dont a ged and they promised they would get me a job my name [redacted] please help me.‚Äù She asked not to be named because of her felony.</p>\n<p>At Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee outpost, according to allegations in the Wisconsin attorney general‚Äôs lawsuit, the campus president insisted on turning away students with criminal records who wanted to enroll in health care programs because they could not be employed in the fields they were training for. When the president left, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p9/a186623\">the suit alleges</a>, the school not only ceased using background checks, it called back those students with criminal records who had been turned away and tried to enroll them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255025\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"396\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 348px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255025','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A promotional mailing sent to prospective students, which was included in the complaint by Wisconsin‚Äôs attorney general. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Wisconsin Attorney General / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/complaint-corinthian-colleges-20141027.pdf\">wordpress.com</a></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Everest voluntarily closed the Wisconsin campus two years after its opening, acknowledging it had problems.

Her boss, the admissions representative said, told her to ‚Äúput them through anyway‚Äù and ensure they sat in the class for at least five days, enough time for the school to collect their government funding.

Everest told her she was very likely to get one paying $14 an hour in her field of study, medical assisting ‚Äî a nine-month certificate degree program for which she would pay $16,400. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs money I can‚Äôt really afford,‚Äù Roberts told me. ‚ÄúBut I feel like this is the only thing I got.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Roberts, her husband, and their three elementary school‚Äìaged children live on the $8-an-hour salary her husband makes as a laborer in a nearby salvage yard, renting a small, sparsely furnished home from her husband‚Äôs boss. (Her name was changed because she is a current student.) Roberts‚Äô son, who is on the autism spectrum, is homeschooled because of his frequent and sometimes violent outbursts, and she is counting on a night job at a hospital so she can stay home with him. Her 11-year-old niece moved in with the family in September.</p>\n<p>If she doesn‚Äôt get a job, Roberts said, ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. We‚Äôre counting on this for a lot of reasons. We‚Äôre completely counting on it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But Roberts is already worried. In her last two months at Everest, she has had seven teachers for a single medical assistant course. She tallies them off on her fingers: Most quit, one saying she‚Äôd never been paid, several moved, others disappeared with no explanation. ‚ÄúWe show up and they‚Äôre gone,‚Äù she said. Instead of normal good-byes at the end of class, she said, students say to teachers, ‚ÄúHope we see you tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations in the many lawsuits against Corinthian Colleges paint a grim picture of the likelihood that Roberts will get the medical assistant job she says she was promised.</p>\n<p>To encourage students to enroll, Corinthian routinely <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186739\">told prospective students</a> that they had job placement rates of 70%, often as high as 90%. But those were ‚Äúsubstantially and materially false,‚Äù according to allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit: In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186740\">one example</a>, a 72% placement rate was in fact 23%.</p>\n<p>In its lawsuit, the California attorney general‚Äôs office alleges that just a tiny fraction of the jobs Everest claimed it had placed students in, often around 30%, could be <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p13/a186748\">fully verified</a>. Most job placement records were ‚Äúmissing,‚Äù and for those records that could be found, the company routinely counted short-term positions as ‚Äúcareers‚Äù or included jobs that students were working outside of the fields they had trained for. One example <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p29/a186749\">cited in the suit</a> were dozens of students whose ‚Äúcareers‚Äù consisted of placements at health-screening fairs that lasted just two days.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn some cases,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p10/a186746\">the California suit reads,</a> ‚Äúthere is no evidence that a single student in a program obtained a job during the time frame specified.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations about falsified and misleading job placement rates are also at the center of the federal lawsuit, as well as suits in Wisconsin and Massachusetts and investigations in six other states. The lawsuit in Wisconsin alleges that in 2011, the actual job placement rate at Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee campus, which the company voluntarily shut down in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p14/a3\">was 5.5%</a>.</p>\n<p>Corinthian <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html\">strongly disputes</a> these allegations, saying that the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of Everest‚Äôs graduates find a job in their field. The company argues that the standards used to verify jobs in the Massachusetts suit, requiring job placements to be long-term, are <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html#document/p3/a186753\">not reflected in state law</a>. In the California suit, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357171-cci-response-to-california-attorney-general.html#document/p20/a186756\">Corinthian said</a>, the state selectively pulled from emails and internal documents to create ‚Äúout-of-context‚Äù and ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù impressions of the company‚Äôs job placement rates.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe have a vested interest in helping our graduates succeed in the job market,‚Äù said Jenkins. He added that Everest‚Äôs accreditation is tied to its ability to prove that its students are placed in jobs: It must submit job placement statistics and records to the school‚Äôs accrediting body.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits against the company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p26/a186759\">allege</a> that those numbers, too, were falsified.</p>\n<p>Students told me that Everest‚Äôs advertised job placement programs were limited to things like reviewing resumes and, in many cases, were all but nonexistent. Several students said that Everest staff had simply forwarded them Craigslist postings or referred them to classified ads in local newspapers. Many said they had been placed in temporary jobs, called ‚Äúexternships,‚Äù which were pre-arranged with employers and lasted anywhere from a few days to months. But once they graduated and the temporary internships the school had placed them in were over, students said, they were unable to get back in touch with job placement staff.</p>\n<p>For Mary Parks, who graduated from Everest in January, Everest‚Äôs ‚Äújob placement services‚Äù were limited to a single emailed job opportunity, a non-management internship at the retailer where she was already a cashier. After she told the school that she didn‚Äôt get the job, ‚ÄúI have not seen or heard from them since,‚Äù she said, despite emails to her caseworker. Parks has an associate degree in business management that cost $34,000, but is working a part-time job that pays just above minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Corinthian said it employs 600 career counselors for its 70,000 students, and that an internal corporate verification team checks the company‚Äôs job placement claims. ‚ÄúWe know of no traditional college or university that has made a remotely comparable commitment to career services,‚Äù said Jenkins. Community colleges generally have much lower graduation rates and lower employment rates, and employ just a handful of career counselors per 1,000 students.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that the company ‚Äúdoes not promise employment to students, period,‚Äù and does not directly provide students with information about salaries, instead referring them to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>Somehow, however, more than 50 students who contacted me came away from Everest with the impression that they had been ‚Äúpromised‚Äù jobs that they did not receive. Allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit against Corinthian back up the students‚Äô assertions: The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186613\">suit alleges</a> ‚ÄúCorinthian employees promised or guaranteed employment despite knowing it could not fulfill such promises.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the country‚Äôs biggest for-profit college lobbying group, argues that even if they fail to immediately find well-paying jobs after graduation, students leave Everest and other for-profit schools better off than when they entered: At least they have a degree or certification, and thus a chance at a better job.</p>\n<p>But an overwhelming majority of the students that I spoke to believe the opposite: They said, often fiercely, that they wished they had never enrolled.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was the worst decision of my life,‚Äù said Christine Gillan, who is $12,000 in debt for a medical assistant certificate she received in 2009. She never found a job in her field and now works as a cleaner at a health club.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad that I worked so hard and have nothing to show for it,‚Äù said Tiffany Jones, a mother of four who graduated from an Everest program in medical billing in Reseda, California, last year, but never found a job in her field. Jenkins, the Corinthian spokesman, said the school had made several efforts to reach out to Jones, which she did not respond to, and had ultimately helped her set up a job interview. Her experience, he said, ‚Äúdemonstrates that employers value an Everest education and were willing to interview her.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At that interview, Jones said, the employer asked her why she had wasted her money on an Everest education instead of a different, cheaper school. She didn‚Äôt get the job.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255438\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:description=\"‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3509316_4255438\" rel:via=\"molly_hc  \" rel:sub_title=\"‚ÄúI%20have%20nothing%20to%20show%20my%20children%20about%20why%20staying%20in%20s\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:19\" rel:count=\"7\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"\" style=\"font-family: 'News Cycle'; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.5000000000000004em; font-size: 28px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #224178; \">‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúMy husband and I are still struggling to keep food on the table, a roof over our heads, and our bills paid.

But while Everest is nationally accredited, almost all nonprofit schools have regional accreditations, and accept few, if any, Everest credits. Transferring in most parts of the country is all but impossible.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said students must initial a paragraph in an enrollment document stating that transferability is out of Everest‚Äôs control and that students ‚Äúshould expect credits not to transfer.‚Äù He noted that national accreditation, which is designed specifically for career programs, has more stringent standards than regional accreditation, such as job placement and graduation requirements that community colleges do not have to meet.</p>\n<p>He also pointed to a single state, Florida, where thanks to a statewide course record system, a selection of Everest‚Äôs courses are transferable to public universities.</p>\n<p>The lack of credit transferability works in Everest‚Äôs favor, interviews with former students show.

Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, the nation‚Äôs largest civil rights organization, is still a director; he joined soon after the company donated $1 million to his organization in 2012. Morial is paid upwards of $60,000 a year for his service on the board. A prominent Democrat, he was the mayor of New Orleans for eight years and once sat on President Obama‚Äôs Equity and Excellence in Education Commission, which was tasked with addressing opportunities for the federal government to address educational inequality.</p>\n<p>In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Morial said, ‚ÄúI joined the Corinthian board as someone who is committed to civil rights and equal opportunity for all and who has spent a lifetime working to advance that mission‚Ä¶ As many institutions have increasingly shifted from extensive offerings of career and vocational training, a void has emerged across the country for students, especially non-traditional students, to have an opportunity to learn a trade and gain desirable workplace skills. The concept of increased vocational training to help fill this void is sound, and it absolutely must be delivered positively, ethically and within the law.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Another Corinthian director was Leon Panetta, the former secretary of defense, who sat on the board during the years of the school‚Äôs biggest growth, from 2008‚Äì2009. He left to join the Obama administration, then rejoined the board in 2013, a year after a <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">Senate report on for-profit colleges</a> found Corinthian to be among the worst performers in the industry, with student loan default rates higher than any other publicly traded company. He left the board after just 11 weeks, <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114041/leon-panetta-quits-corinthian-colleges-why\">facing pressure from critics</a> of Corinthian. Panetta declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>While the directors oversaw the business and were paid for their time, its owners were the biggest beneficiaries of its profits. One of the company‚Äôs largest shareholders has been Graham Holdings, formerly the Washington Post Company, which also owns Kaplan Inc., an education company and for-profit college chain.</p>\n<p>And throughout its troubled final years, Corinthian was supported by industry lobbyists, most notably the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, or APSCU. APSCU has been a force in Washington politics, most notably suing the Obama administration after a 2011 attempt to regulate the for-profit college industry, forcing the administration to revise the rules, delaying implementation for three years. Corinthian, an APSCU member, would have been among the hardest hit by those rules.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, taxpayers were the company‚Äôs largest supporter. Corinthian received 83% of its revenue from tax dollars at its enrollment peak in 2010, some $1.4 billion, and has raked in about $10 billion in the past 10 years. And it is taxpayers, through the federal student loan system, who will effectively act as debt collectors, chasing Everest‚Äôs former students for payment for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254364\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 999px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254364','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">California Attorney General Kamala Harris. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Eric Risberg / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In 2007, the California attorney general filed a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357643-california2007complaint-2.html\">lawsuit</a> against Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs parent company. California‚Äôs complaint against Everest and Corinthian included a litany of allegations: falsified job placement statistics, aggressive and unethical sales practices, and a pattern of jobless graduates carrying mountains of debt.</p>\n<p>But that case never went to trial: The lawsuit was immediately settled with no admission of wrongdoing on Corinthian‚Äôs part. The company paid a $500,000 civil penalty and $4.3 million in restitution to students at campuses that had notched the worst violations. As of this year, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on background, $3.4 million of that money has been paid out to 6,000 eligible students, for a total of approximately $560 each.</p>\n<p>Six years later, a new California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, filed a new lawsuit against Corinthian that was, for the most part, indistinguishable from the first complaint, detailing the same violations, alleging that the company had materially broken every agreement made in the previous settlement. The recent federal lawsuit, and those in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, trace similar lines.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education began <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-heightens-oversight-corinthian-colleges\">its own investigation</a> into Corinthian in January, requesting details on everything from the company‚Äôs job placement rates to financial aid practices. In June, it claimed Corinthian was taking too long to respond completely, and temporarily cut off the school‚Äôs access to the federal financial aid money that made up almost 90% of its revenue. Corinthian was so short on cash that even the 21-day delay sent them into a financial tailspin, threatening bankruptcy; the DOE eventually agreed to release the funds, but only on the condition that Corinthian would sell off or close all of its campuses within six months. The final list included only 12 schools that would be shut down; Corinthian plans to sell the other 85, likely to a private equity firm or a for-profit competitor.</p>\n<p>But the lawsuits, investigations, and even the Department of Education‚Äôs forced shutdown are unlikely to result in any real change for the vast majority of Everest‚Äôs current and former students. One of the deep ironies of Corinthian‚Äôs collapse is that there are, experts say, effectively too many victims for there to be any reasonable way to compensate them, or to actually shut down the dozens of Everest campuses. It would cost the government billions to forgive the outstanding debt of former students, and any attempt to shut down Corinthian‚Äôs schools would displace 70,000 current ones.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seeks debt relief for students ‚Äî but only on a tiny fraction of loans, those made directly by Corinthian, not the federal loans that make up the vast majority of students‚Äô debt. Lawsuits in California, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts may provide some restitution to former students in those states, but like the 2007 settlement, would do little more than chip away at students‚Äô loan tallies.</p>\n<p>Corinthian College‚Äôs impending demise will likely work against former students, said Pauline Abernathy, the vice president of policy organization The Institute for College Access and Success. ‚ÄúThe issue is, if [the government] were to win a lawsuit, where would the money come from to compensate students?‚Äù Abernathy said.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs all but impossible that any real money will come from Corinthian. Corinthian is so cash-strapped that it has been selling off assets ‚Äî even equipment belonging to its chain of automotive schools ‚Äî just to stay afloat until it finds a buyer for its campuses. It is extremely unlikely, experts agree, that any state would be able to recover a substantial settlement from the company.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe chances are slim‚Äù that former students will ever see any kind of meaningful debt relief, said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the advocacy group Center for Responsible Lending.</p>\n<p>And because all former students signed arbitration agreements, Dundon said, they are unable to take part in class-action lawsuits in open court, and must instead take their cases to arbitration. That can be problematic because arbitration suits are difficult to file, and, in a more business-friendly environment, do not carry with them the right to appeal. ‚ÄúThe worst thing is that the process is not public, so you can‚Äôt find out what the allegations are,‚Äù said Dundon.</p>\n<p>In the years between when the two lawsuits were filed in California, Everest boomed, reaching a height of 113,000 students in 2010. That was the year immediately after the economic crisis, when students flocked to for-profit schools in search of jobs. Enrollments ‚Äî and revenues ‚Äî fell sharply beginning in 2010, and Corinthian‚Äôs stock price slid alongside it. In 2009, the company was valued at around $1.4 billion. In the wake of the Education Department‚Äôs shutdown, its shares have been trading at around 18 cents, valuing the business at $14 million ‚Äî just $2.5 million more than the asking price of Massimino‚Äôs house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255398\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"759\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 711px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255398','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jose Luis Magana / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Many Everest students who contacted me had deep misconceptions about the most basic financial aspects of their expensive educations, from the amount of tuition to who was shouldering the cost of their degree. Kelli McClendon, a former student of Everest College Online, wrote: ‚ÄúI was getting $5500 financial aid. The course was only $4500. Yet I found out I still had to take out loans to pay for my classes.‚Äù The cost of McClendon‚Äôs program was actually $13,500 ‚Äî she had been told the cost for one quarter, rather than three.</p>\n<p>The students who told me that they were misled about the nature of their debts had all ostensibly gone through financial aid counseling, signing papers that listed the amount of money they were borrowing and the interest rates on their loans. That‚Äôs a government-mandated process, designed to ensure students understand the implications of the debt they are about to enter into.</p>\n<p>But interviews with former students and employees show Everest‚Äôs version of that process <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p34/a186789\">obscured the full cost of its education</a> and sometimes even led students to believe that they were not borrowing money at all. Some said their loans were misrepresented as grants that would not have to be repaid. Students said they were given a ‚Äútuition cost‚Äù that was per quarter or per credit, apparently without explaining that distinction. Others were told they would ‚Äúpay nothing out of pocket,‚Äù or that the school would help them find ‚Äúgovernment-sector jobs‚Äù where they would not have to repay their loans.</p>\n<p>Failing to provide complete program costs to students is in violation of Corinthian‚Äôs policies, said Jenkins. ‚ÄúAny suggestion that clear information about the cost of programs is not made available to prospective students is demonstrably false,‚Äù he said. He pointed to Corinthian‚Äôs website, where, he said, ‚ÄúYou can see that anyone can visit one of our websites and get the precise cost of any program and the availability of grants and loans to cover that cost.‚Äù (<a href=\"http://www.everest.edu/campus/chesapeake/program/criminal-justice\">This</a> is the type of page most students would navigate to find out program costs.)</p>\n<p>Admissions personnel were never allowed to discuss financial aid directly with students, according to the first former admissions representative ‚Äî ‚Äúthey would fire you on the spot if you mentioned financial aid‚Äù ‚Äî but were instead told to promise students that, once they had signed initial enrollment papers, they would be given financial aid counseling. But more often than not, she said, students left that single counseling session confused about what they had signed. ‚ÄúA couple days into class, I‚Äôd often get calls from students I enrolled saying, ‚ÄòI think I took out a loan? I don‚Äôt understand, what did this mean?‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut you couldn‚Äôt answer. You could only give them the runaround and say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt have to pay it back until after you graduate.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Often, the admissions representative said, and especially with students who spoke limited English, ‚ÄúI got the impression they didn‚Äôt know what they were signing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Though they were presented with papers that would have explained the terms and amounts of the grants and loans they were taking out, many students said they were not given time to read the papers. They instead trusted the words of their financial aid counselors, who promised to ‚Äúexplain everything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One former financial aid counselor at Everest College-Phoenix said she and other representatives ‚Äúnever discussed anything about the total cost of attendance‚Äù with students. When total costs came up, students were quickly assured they would be ‚Äúcovered by financial aid.‚Äù By the end of a single phone call with online students, the financial aid counselor said, she had signed students up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without the student‚Äôs full understanding of what they had agreed to.</p>\n<p>Everest educations are expensive: More than five times as expensive as a degree from a community college, and twice as expensive as a degree from a state university. The cost is no accident; it‚Äôs largely a by-product of a federal rule governing for-profit colleges, known as ‚Äúthe 90/10 rule,‚Äù which mandates that schools can draw a maximum of 90% of their revenue from federal aid money.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs tuition is set at a price high enough that some students eventually max out their federal aid, forcing them to turn to other sources to pay for the final slice of their tuition, often around $5,000. Usually, that ‚Äúfunding gap‚Äù is covered by a private loan made by Everest itself, called a Genesis loan, which charges a maximum of 9.9% interest, nearly twice as much as an unsubsidized loan made by the federal government.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students said that they were not informed ahead of time that they would need to take out private loans in addition to government funding. Most said they were told within months or even weeks of graduation that they had ‚Äúrun out of funding, and that if they wanted to graduate, they would need to sign up for a Genesis loan.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins noted that less than 40% of Corinthian‚Äôs students take out private loans. ‚ÄúThis program was never intended to be and has never been a profit center,‚Äù he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255314\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"873\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 825px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255314','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Paula Dougherty, who is studying business administration at Everest, lives in rural Warrior, Alabama. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Paula Dougherty isn‚Äôt sure how much money she‚Äôs paying for a two-year associate degree in business administration at Everest University Online; she was never told, and she never asked.

Money for groceries when her family‚Äôs food stamps run out.</p>\n<p>Dougherty is unemployed and living on $700 a month in disability payments; she has only ever had one job, as a greeter at Walmart, which lasted two months. Four hundred dollars are eaten up in rent for a bedroom in a mobile home on the outskirts of Warrior, Alabama, which she shares with her aunt, uncle, cousin, his wife, and a dozen dogs and cats.</p>\n<p>So the stipend checks Dougherty gets from Everest every semester ‚Äî essentially cash payments taken from student loans ‚Äî are more than a bonus.

For-profit colleges say they offer poor and working students things that public and nonprofit colleges cannot: job-centric degrees, flexible course schedules for single parents and full-time workers, environments geared toward older students and veterans rather than recent high school graduates.</p>\n<p>The numbers behind the industry as a whole are troubling: Just 13% of American higher-education students attend for-profit colleges, but they account for 30% of all outstanding student loans ‚Äî and almost half of student loan defaults. The graduation rate stands at 32%. But the for-profit college industry defends those figures by saying they are explained by the schools‚Äô demographics: Studies have shown poor students are less likely to graduate, and it stands to reason that they have to borrow much more too. They also frequently compare themselves to community colleges, where graduation rates are actually lower and loan default rates often equally as high.</p>\n<p>Community colleges are significantly less expensive: an average of $8,500 vs. $35,000, meaning that only 42% of community college students are forced to go into debt for two-year degrees, compared with more than 88% of for-profit college students. They borrow, on average, twice as much as community college students.</p>\n<p>The for-profit college industry has also come under fire for much more than its student borrowing and graduation rates. Corinthian is widely known as being among the worst offenders in the industry, but it‚Äôs far from alone in its record of legal action. In January, attorneys general in 12 states announced investigations into the practices of three massive publicly traded for-profits: EDMC, ITT Educational Services, and Career Education Corporation. EDMC, which recently delisted itself from the stock exchange, faced a similar investigation in 2010; the 55,000-student ITT Educational is being investigated by the SEC and sued, like Corinthian, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\n<p>The University of Phoenix, the country‚Äôs largest and best-known for-profit, has been investigated in several different states. It <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/university-phoenix-settles-false-claims-act-lawsuit-675-million\">settled with the Justice Department</a> over its recruiting practices for $67 million in 2009, after a government review, according to the <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/0914apollo14.html\"><i>Arizona Republic</i></a>, ‚Äúpaint[ed] a picture of a school so hungry to enroll new students that it has threatened and intimidated its recruitment staff in meetings and e-mail, pressured them to enroll unqualified students and covered up its practices to deceive regulators.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For its part, the Obama administration has tried ‚Äî and, so far, failed ‚Äî to impose meaningful regulations on the industry. In 2011, the administration rolled out a series of so-called ‚Äúgainful-employment‚Äù regulations meant to shut down the worst-performing career college programs. Programs were required to meet one of two metrics relating to loan repayment and debt-to-income ratios. Those that failed were disproportionately for-profit college programs.</p>\n<p>Many critics of the industry actually regarded the 2011 regulations as too lax, criticizing the administration for bowing to the demands of for-profit college lobbyists. The most prominent for-profit lobby group sued the Education Department anyway, and the rules were thrown out on a technical argument that the metrics chosen by the department were arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Last week, the administration released a new version of the regulations that, though tougher than the 2011 iteration, caved in to a key lobbying demand by the for-profit college industry. Some lawmakers are skeptical the new regulations will work as hoped. ‚ÄúI do not believe that this rule will be enough to prevent bad actors in the for-profit sector from gaming the system and taking advantage of our students,‚Äù said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat, in a statement. APSCU, the for-profit college lobbying organization, has already filed a lawsuit to strike down the new attempt at regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255297\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1019px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255297','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A photograph of Jennifer Wilson at her graduation from Everest. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph Molly Hensley-Clancey for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Jennifer Wilson still keeps a framed portrait in her living room of herself at graduation, beaming in a cap and gown and holding a leather folder that reads ‚ÄúEverest University‚Äù against her chest. She was so happy in that moment, she said: She had finally graduated from college ‚Äî a dream she‚Äôd had since she was a teenager ‚Äî with an associate of science degree in criminal justice. She was on her way, she hoped, to a better job.</p>\n<p>But Wilson, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, was yet to understand the extent of the debt she was carrying. ‚ÄúI had no idea how much my loans were coming to,‚Äù she said; she had been rushed through the signing process without anybody mentioning the total cost of her program. Weeks after graduation, she started getting bills for the rest of her student loan debt. The total cost of her two-year associate degree: $40,000.</p>\n<p>She would soon find her degree was essentially ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù she said, and came with none of the job placement services she‚Äôd been promised. No police departments would hire her, although she‚Äôd been told her program had a near-perfect job placement rate; it was 2010, so some blamed the economy, but others said it was because of the quality of her degree.</p>\n<p>At her local community college, Wilson learned, a similar two-year degree would have cost around $7,000.</p>\n<p>By then, the joy of that Everest cap-and-gown moment was long gone. It had begun to fade even on graduation day. As she walked off the stage that afternoon, she opened the embossed folder for a first look at her diploma; instead, she found a letter from Everest, demanding that she pay $3,000 in private loans she still owed the school. Until she paid up, she wouldn‚Äôt officially graduate or receive her diploma. With a salary of $25,000 a year, it would take her three years, and a loan from her mother, to come up with the money.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI hated myself,‚Äù Wilson said, her voice catching as she spoke. She is still working in the same job she had when she graduated. ‚ÄúI thought, <i>I am</i> so <i>much smarter than this</i>.

I‚Äôm a man-and-a-woman type of guy.‚Äù When the ESPN documentary declared that Michael Sr. had ‚Äúabandoned the family‚Äù and left his mother to raise Michael Jr. and his seven siblings on her own, Michael Sr. seemed the archetype of the intolerant and absent black father.</p>\n<p>In none of these accounts did Michael Jr. come to his father‚Äôs defense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to my friends than I am to my family,‚Äù Michael Jr. told the <i>T</i><i>imes</i>.</p>\n<p>But the father-son story of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. is more than a conflict over whether Michael Sr. loved and supported his son.

The rift between Michael Sr. and his youngest son started long before Michael Jr. came out and stems in no small part from those family tragedies.</p>\n<p>Of course, those losses shaped Michael Jr. too, but he isn‚Äôt saying how. Through his agent and publicist, he declined numerous requests for an interview. But it‚Äôs not hard to see how, in order to succeed and perhaps just to survive, he might blame his father, fairly or not, for what happened to his family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240900\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1407\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1324px; top: 432px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240900','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Joel Anderson/BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Michael Sr. spends most of his days at the DeSoto Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 15 miles southwest of Dallas. His electric hospital-style bed and almost all of his few belongings ‚Äî a mini-fridge and a rolling dinner tray, mostly ‚Äî are crammed into a corner of the room he shares with another patient. He locks his drawers because someone has been stealing his snacks.</p>\n<p>He gets around in a wheelchair, having lost his ability to walk almost three years ago. He wears a gold chain around his broad neck, which bears a deep and long surgical scar that runs from the bottom of his hairline to somewhere past the neckline of his white undershirt. It‚Äôs not clear he knows exactly what ailment has left him in a wheelchair. ‚ÄúI have a hole in my neck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I ain‚Äôt gonna die in this motherfucker. I‚Äôm getting out of here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At 55, he‚Äôs one of the youngest and most vibrant residents at the nursing home. He has a paunch and false teeth, but he still possesses the thickly muscled shoulders and arms of someone nicknamed ‚ÄúHammer,‚Äù a handle he got on the football field and in the streets. His hands still make large fists; kicking ass was a family pastime.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaaaannnn, I used to hit hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI taught all my sons to play football.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He often rolls his wheelchair to a shaded patio, where he goes through Kool cigarettes like some people do cups of coffee. He banters with almost everyone. Especially the women. ‚ÄúBetter quit bending that ass over like that,‚Äù he tells one of the women staffers, a smile creasing his fleshy face. The woman smiles back. If she or other women staffers are offended by his behavior, they don‚Äôt show it. At least a couple jokingly call him their boyfriend.</p>\n<p>His phone rings throughout the day, bearing calls from his children or friends named ‚ÄùFrank Tha Cook‚Äù or ‚ÄúLittle Leroy.‚Äù The conversations usually cover his health, upcoming casino trips to Louisiana, and football, particularly the Cowboys, his favorite team since he was a boy.</p>\n<p>One person who doesn‚Äôt call is Michael Jr., who kept his distance as he ascended to fame and more recently when he tumbled out of big-time football.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242159\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"319\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 271px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242159','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Michael Sam in 2013 playing for the University of Missouri. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Joe Robbins / Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>After Michael Jr. publicly came out in February, even President Obama <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2014/story/_/id/10468033/president-barack-obama-applauds-missouri-michael-sam-coming-out\">praised the announcement</a>. On May 10, the St. Louis Rams drafted him, generating more praise. But despite the fact that he had been a star at the University of Missouri, where he became Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the powerful Southeastern Conference, he was chosen late. Only seven players were selected after him. He performed well during training camp and the preseason ‚Äî but was still cut from the final roster on Aug. 30, touching off a debate about whether homophobia played a role in his release. The Cowboys signed him three days later to their practice squad, then dropped him on Oct. 21. He is now a free agent.</p>\n<p>For the nearly two months that Michael Jr. was with the Cowboys, he lived a half hour away from his father. It was the closest they‚Äôve lived to each other in about 15 years. A family friend, Sean Woods, hoped it would finally bring the men together. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, Michael Jr. ‚Äúhas to deal with his daddy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet the Michaels have exchanged only a few text messages and haven‚Äôt spoken a word to each other, a quiet that has now lasted at least several months with no end in sight. Michael Sr. has mostly kept up with the vicissitudes of his son‚Äôs career through updates on ESPN and phone calls from friends and family members.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Michael Jr. was released from the Cowboys‚Äô practice squad, Michael Sr. sent a text to BuzzFeed News: ‚ÄúHey they cut Mike.‚Äù Asked if he‚Äôd heard from his son recently, Michael Sr. texted back that Michael Jr. ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt say a word to me honer [sic] thy father.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he was looking for an excuse to separate from us,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre just letting him have his limelight. We‚Äôre tired of begging him to stay in the family.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the room‚Äôs walls, Michael Sr. has pinned Father‚Äôs Day cards, a corkboard with a calendar and pictures of his family, and, over his bed, a lengthy poem about angels. On a special spot on the wall ‚Äî right over his flat-screen TV ‚Äî are two pictures of Michael Jr. in his University of Missouri football uniform. Pointing at the pictures, Michael Sr. said he knew from the start that Michael Jr. would be special.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat boy, he had some big nuts,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe was big when he was born. That boy had some big-ass balls.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240913\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240913','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-2794-1415827237-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Paul Moseley/Fort Worth Star-Telegram / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Wesley Sam, Michael Sr.‚Äôs father, was also pretty ballsy. In 1947, he was living in Opelousas, Louisiana, when he heard on the radio about what‚Äôs generally considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_disaster#Scale_of_the_disaster\">the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history</a>, an explosion at the Monsanto plant near Galveston, Texas. He headed right to the scene, figuring he could get work there.</p>\n<p>He loaded cotton at the Galveston wharves for a few months before landing a job at the Monsanto plant. Yes, it had blown up, killing nearly 600 people, but he could make more money there than a black man could expect almost anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He married Alberta, a fellow Opelousas native who spoke Creole, little English, and who couldn‚Äôt read or write. With their 10 children, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 1732 Thompson St. in La Marque: Wesley and Alberta had a bedroom, the girls had one, and the boys had the room at the back of the house. ‚ÄúI had a white boy type of life at home,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt nothing I couldn‚Äôt have wanted and gotten.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Alberta died at 46 following ‚Äúa brief illness,‚Äù according to her obituary in the <i>La Marque Times</i>. Wesley Sam was a loving man, a capable cook, and obsessive about cleanliness ‚Äî he would dust off his car every day, his surviving children said. But he wasn‚Äôt quite up to the challenge of corralling all of those children. Who could? Instead he set his example through his work ethic, putting in a full day at Monsanto then mowing lawns with his sons in the evening. They‚Äôd do 18 yards a day, Wednesday through Sunday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy dad was a workaholic before anyone called it that,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd think you were sorry if you didn‚Äôt have that work mentality in you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr.‚Äôs siblings went off to college, joined the military, and found middle-class jobs. His sister Geraldine would become La Marque‚Äôs first black mayor.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr., meanwhile, dropped out of school over the protests of his father but earned a GED. He wasn‚Äôt much of a student anyway, and finding work in the area was a cinch for anyone who didn‚Äôt mind getting a few smudges on their shirt. He worked in construction, at a chemical plant, and as a crane operator and a forklift operator.</p>\n<p>Away from work, Michael Sr. and his brothers drank, chased women, and kept up the family tradition of fisticuffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be out in the front yard fighting,‚Äù Michael Sr. said, grinning at the memory. ‚ÄúReal fighting. Not no slapboxing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One night in 1978, Michael Sr. met a woman named JoAnn Turner at a local nightclub. ‚ÄúShe was fine and good-looking,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I walked her out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Little more than a year later, JoAnn gave birth to a boy they named Russell. A year later, they had daughter Chanel. Julian was born in June 1982. They were young and in love, with three kids and jobs that paid middle-class wages. It didn‚Äôt take long for Michael Sr. to settle into life as a family man, or long for it to be destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4241207\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"697\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 649px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4241207','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs a news brief from the Associated Press on Sept. 23, 1982, with a dateline from Texas City: ‚ÄúThe body of Chanel Roshaun Sam was found Monday night in about eight feet of water near a pier on which she had been playing. Her parents and neighbors searched for three hours before finding the body.‚Äù The little girl, 2 years old, had apparently drowned.</p>\n<p>After several days of grief, and desperate to rescue JoAnn from her despair, Michael Sr. suggested they go to the courthouse. And so, six days after their daughter died, they were married.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt like she needed some support,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was the right thing to do, to bring something positive from it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt enough. JoAnn turned to religion and became a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. Her conversion deepened the fissure in her marriage, because Michael Sr. was raised as a Baptist and felt his wife‚Äôs new religion was too restrictive. She insisted the family not celebrate Christmas. ‚ÄúI celebrated it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt celebrate it with me. I still bought the kids gifts.‚Äù (JoAnn didn‚Äôt respond to requests for an interview.)</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. found his solace shooting dice. On Friday and Saturday evenings, he would take his paycheck to a little wooden shack in Texas City and gamble away the family‚Äôs money. JoAnn suspected the absences were because of another woman, Michael Sr. said. But a mutual friend of the couple gave her the scoop. In Michael Sr.‚Äôs version of the story, the woman told JoAnn that ‚Äúhe ain‚Äôt screwing none of us‚Äù but was just gambling.</p>\n<p>One Friday night, Michael Sr. recalled, he won $700 and left the shack with two friends on an impromptu trip to Boy‚Äôs Town in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, an infamous red-light district just across the Texas border. He didn‚Äôt bother calling JoAnn to tell her that he was leaving town.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt no cell phones back then, and I didn‚Äôt stop and spend the 25 cents to call,‚Äù he said. When he returned Sunday, ‚Äúshe bitched at my ass. But it was pretty funny. I had a blast.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage continued to spiral, though Joshua was born in 1984 and Christopher in 1985. Michael Sr. finally filed for divorce in February 1986. A brief attempt at reconciliation resulted in the birth of Michelle in 1987. But the divorce was granted in 1988.</p>\n<p>JoAnn was awarded primary parental responsibilities. Michael Sr. would have access to the children two weekends each month, and they divided up the holidays.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. was also ordered to pay JoAnn $250 each month for child support. Within a few months, JoAnn returned to court to complain that Michael Sr. wasn‚Äôt meeting his obligation. Thus started a four-year battle over child support. Michael Sr. was charged with contempt of court at least 10 times stemming from his failure to pay, according to court records. Twice he was sent to county jail.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242796\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 392px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242796','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">The District Clerk's Office of Galveston County</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúIt was because I was running around and spending money and shooting dice,‚Äù Michael Sr. said.

As a freshman, he was pegged as a future football star at La Marque High School. Michael Sr. fondly remembers how Russell would walk around the neighborhood, ‚Äúalways ready to slap a motherfucker.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But, he said, ‚ÄúI kept telling him to get out of that gang shit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Here‚Äôs a clipping from the Galveston County <i>Daily News</i>. It reports that on Feb. 27, 1995, Russell was sent home early from La Marque High School for ‚Äúcreating a disturbance.‚Äù A school administrator allowed Russell to walk home since his mother couldn‚Äôt leave work to pick him up.</p>\n<p>Instead of heading straight home, the newspaper said, Russell stopped at a house about a half mile from the school. He was breaking into the back door when the homeowner fired at him three times through a metal door. Russell was clutching a screwdriver when his body was found. No charges were filed against the homeowner (who was also black).</p>\n<p>The anger welled up within Michael Sr., who casually knew the man who had killed his son. There weren‚Äôt many strangers on that side of town. Michael Sr. got himself a handgun. ‚ÄúI was going to kill him,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI was going to go over there and end him. But my daddy saved me. He wouldn‚Äôt let me go over there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>His father saved him<i>.</i> But Michael Sr. couldn‚Äôt save his own sons.</p>\n<p>At 5 feet 4 inches and 125 pounds, second-oldest son Julian had an unusually slight build for a Sam boy. He went by the nickname ‚ÄúIce Pick.‚Äù But he had a left arm that was made for pitching. ‚ÄúThat boy could throw,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe used to strike Russell out all the time. Those were the funnest days.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But, Michael Sr. said, ‚Äúhe wanted his own money‚Äù and begged his father to let him work.

Just thinking of it.‚Äù He found work as a crane operator but was laid off soon after. He got a job working for a local pipe company and was let go again. Finally, in the fall of 1999, a family friend told him he should consider truck driving. Michael Sr. went to school in Dallas, and four months later was on the road, coming back to Hitchcock when he could, mostly on weekends.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a steady job,‚Äù he said, and one that answered a deeper need: ‚ÄúI had to get away. I wanted to get away.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage crumbled. Michael Sr. and JoAnn remain legally married but haven‚Äôt lived as a couple since he moved to Dallas in 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was 10 when his father started his life on the road. With JoAnn working late hours and taking extra shifts to provide for the children, Michael Jr.‚Äôs older brothers had their run of the house ‚Äî and the streets. ‚ÄúIt was bad,‚Äù Michael Jr. said in an ESPN documentary about his life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a kid and I‚Äôm seeing some hardcore drugs in my house. My mother didn‚Äôt know about it. If I told her anything, my brothers said they would kill me.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Craig Smith, one of his high school football coaches, saw it for himself. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôd drive over to pick him up and honk the horn and one of his brothers would come out to see if I wanted to buy‚Äù drugs, he told a crowd at the school‚Äôs annual football reunion dinner in late July.</p>\n<p>The criminal records of Michael Jr.‚Äôs brothers support these accounts: Josh has been arrested more than 40 times, including four convictions for drug possession, and Chris has tallied nearly 20 arrests.</p>\n<p>In April, Chris was sentenced to 30 years in state prison for breaking into a woman‚Äôs home, choking her into unconsciousness twice, then using her credit card at a nearby restaurant. Josh was put in the Galveston County Jail in July on a minor offense and was released last month.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI got caught up in them streets,‚Äù Josh admitted during a June interview with BuzzFeed News, a rare evening this year when he wasn‚Äôt locked up.</p>\n<p>Little of this came as a surprise to family members. Cousins remember being warned to keep their distance. ‚ÄúWe knew it wasn‚Äôt the ideal upbringing,‚Äù said Joseph Sam, a nephew of Michael Sr. ‚ÄúThey were always in trouble.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With his childhood saturated with grief and his older brothers descending into crime, Michael Jr. would have had to be a saint not to look for someone to blame. Conveniently, his father was already blaming himself.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, far away from home, Michael Sr. remained tormented by the loss of his boys. Teaching them toughness had backfired; he‚Äôd armed them with tools for survival in one world that wouldn‚Äôt work in almost any other.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLife was going to be tough on them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour skin had to be tougher than the others.

Michael Jr. wasn‚Äôt saying much to his new seatmate. The silence went on for so long and got so awkward that eventually the boy spoke up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI told the teacher that I didn‚Äôt want to sit next to him because he was too quiet,‚Äù said Robert Dohman. ‚ÄúHe turns around and goes, ‚ÄòHey, blondie boy, I‚Äôm not quiet!‚Äô And that‚Äôs the way me and Michael get along now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was voted ‚Äúfriendliest‚Äù by his sixth-grade classmates and elected homecoming king in eighth grade. His popularity was a testament to his ability to navigate the unspoken color line of a small Southern town; most of his close friends were white.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy grandma,‚Äù said Dohman, ‚Äúwas very old-school and wasn‚Äôt into all that racial mixing. But when I had Michael over, he‚Äôd always be the first one to come over and give everybody a hug. Even her. He really changed the way my grandmother looked at black people. She would even smile when he came around.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he saw little of the outgoing side of his son, saying he was quiet at home. But coaches and teachers remember him as a precociously self-assured teenager who could start a conversation with anyone. After football games, Michael Jr. was known for going into the bleachers ‚Äî uniform and pads still on ‚Äî to introduce himself to parents.</p>\n<p>Michael could ‚Äútalk to a group of 15-year-olds and then set there and talk to a group of 55-year-olds and not feel out of place either,‚Äù said Smith, now head football coach at Hitchcock. ‚ÄúI just never had a student that could just go and talk to a group of people. He would make friends all the time.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even in what was ostensibly enemy territory. Smith recalled a track meet at Danbury, a nearby town that is 90% white, less than 1% black, and had developed a reputation for being unfriendly to minorities. Except, apparently, Michael Jr.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can remember some Danbury parents cheering and rooting for Michael running the 100-meter‚Äù dash, Coach Smith said. ‚ÄúYou just didn‚Äôt see that, if you know anything about Danbury.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Maybe the biggest benefit of playing sports is that it kept Michael Jr. away from his brothers. The coaches, who also worked as teachers in the district, knew all about Josh and Chris: Their obvious athleticism had never proven to be worth the trouble.

After nearly 30 years as a father, he said, he could finally engage in the autumn ritual familiar across Texas.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt miss [any] home game his senior year,‚Äù Michael Sr. insisted.</p>\n<p>There isn‚Äôt anyone who can corroborate his perfect attendance. Family and friends say they‚Äôre sure he went to some games but don‚Äôt know about all of them. The coaches at Hitchcock High can remember seeing or, rather, hearing, Michael Sr. only once in four years: a game in Michael Jr.‚Äôs sophomore year.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI heard this guy yelling at Michael and I turned to Michael and asked him, ‚ÄòWho the hell is that guy?‚Äô‚Äù Smith recalled. ‚ÄúMichael said it was his father. That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve ever seen him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Those stadiums can be hubs of activity on Friday nights, and coaches are notoriously focused on the events unfolding well away from the stands. It would be easy to miss someone on game night, <i>right</i>?</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet me say this in a nice way,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know him, and I know a lot of people in town. I can look up in those stands and know who‚Äôs there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he didn‚Äôt make it a priority to spend any time with the parents of Michael Jr.‚Äôs friends or the alums and other regulars who would show up at school events ‚Äî most of them white. ‚ÄúI never did know them,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I never tried to go out of my way.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he took a job with a trucking company based out of Ada, Oklahoma, so that he could arrive in Hitchcock by the start of kickoff Friday night. He assumed his son appreciated what he considered a significant sacrifice of time and money; coming back to Texas without a load meant he wouldn‚Äôt get paid for the drive home.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until earlier this year, when media outlets began saying that he had abandoned his son, that Michael Sr. learned he was being phased out of the story of his son‚Äôs childhood. He never thought all those years on the road would mean that he wasn‚Äôt there.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMichael‚Äôs family was the city of Hitchcock,‚Äù said Dohman, Michael Jr.‚Äôs childhood friend.</p>\n<p>Told what Dohman said, Michael Sr. looked straight ahead, the anger washing over him. Sitting on that patio at the nursing home, he was, for a few moments, that angry Sam boy ready to fight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock didn‚Äôt buy his goddamn clothes, a roof over his head, or the bed that he slept in,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock can kiss my ass.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúI should have kept those gas receipts.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Of course, Michael Sr. never thought he would need them. He also never thought the family of a high school teammate ‚Äî a white one ‚Äî would get so much credit.</p>\n<p>Once Michael Jr. revealed in February his plans to become the NFL‚Äôs first out gay player, the two media outlets with which his publicists coordinated the announcement wrote this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/sports/football/for-nfl-prospect-michael-sam-upbringing-was-bigger-challenge-than-coming-out-as-gay.html?_r=1\">The <i>New York Times</i></a>: Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank. Ron‚Äôs wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sam‚Äôs senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls‚Äô house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags. ‚ÄúI look at our house as a kind of safe haven,‚Äù said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. ‚ÄúHe is just another son. If he did something wrong, he got yelled at just like the others did.‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10453954/michael-sam-safe-havens-football-surrogate-family\">ESPN</a>: The relationship started when Candy Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs wife, invited Michael to dinner during his freshman year of high school. Ronnie, a man with a personality much bigger than he is, discovered a kid he didn‚Äôt recognize and demanded to know, ‚ÄúAnd who are you?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWithout skipping a beat, my brother replied, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Michael Alan Sam Jr.!,‚Äô‚Äù said Ethan Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúAnd after that, he never left.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bunch of shit,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. Sure, he said, his son went to the Purls‚Äô on weekends, but ‚ÄúMichael lived at home to the day he graduated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe lived with the rest of us,‚Äù agreed Michael Jr.‚Äôs sister Michelle.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Purls only helped [him] in [his] senior year,‚Äù his aunt Geraldine said. ‚ÄúIf the Purls were really good people, they‚Äôd tell Michael that he was wrong. That he should acknowledge his mother and daddy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>After a brief phone conversation in which he said he didn‚Äôt have time to speak, Ethan Purl did not return repeated phone calls. Ronnie Purl declined a number of interview requests. ‚ÄúWithout Michael‚Äôs approval I will not be able to speak with you,‚Äù he said in an email. ‚ÄúBeing in banking, I am very aware of privacy issues.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he met the Purls at least once, when he accompanied Michael Jr. on one of his visits over there.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI just wanted to see where Michael was going, to make sure where he was going was the right environment,‚Äù Michael Sr. said.</p>\n<p>In fact, Michael Sr. liked that his youngest son had white friends. He was convinced his association with them might mean better grades, a high school diploma, and maybe even college ‚Äî the chance at success that his other sons never had.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt messing with the black guys trying to sell drugs and doing drugs ‚Äî I thought that was a good thing,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAs long as he wasn‚Äôt doing nothing crazy, wasn‚Äôt in no cult, I was all right with it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243316\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-26050-1415827473-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"798\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 750px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:14\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243316','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-26050-1415827473-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A yearbook page shows Michael Sam during his high school days in Hitchcock, Texas. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Scott Dalton/The New York Times/REDUX</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>When Michael Jr. was at the University of Missouri, Michael Sr. began noticing some changes in his son, he recalled.

How else to explain Vito coming home for the holidays? Michael Sr. waited until they returned to Missouri to broach his suspicions to his wife. ‚ÄúI told JoAnn, ‚ÄòYou know, Mike ain‚Äôt bring his girlfriend but he brought this dude. That‚Äôs kinda funny,‚Äô‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúBut she swore up and down‚Äù that he wasn‚Äôt gay. ‚ÄúI kept asking Mike was this boy funny? ‚ÄòNo, Daddy, no.

I told my brother that that boy right there is gay.‚Äù</p>\n<p>When they went out for dinner later that night, Michael Jr. showed them a picture of a woman he said he was dating; Michael Jr.‚Äôs Instagram account has lots of pictures of him in college posing with young women.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI still had some suspicions,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. But other family members ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna believe it. I had intuition about that boy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That intuition was finally confirmed this year. On Feb. 4, Michael Sr.‚Äôs birthday, he received a text message from his son. ‚ÄúI could tell his PR guy wrote that message because Mike don‚Äôt talk like that,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was some bullshit. ‚ÄòI wanted to inform you that I‚Äôm gay.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got to say?‚Äù Michael Sr. remembered texting Michael Jr. in response. ‚ÄúHe texted me back, ‚ÄòHappy birthday.‚Äô So I went out and got drunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Five months later, in his room at the nursing home watching the red carpet show before his son would receive the Arthur Ashe Award, Michael Sr. grew wildly upset. He started calling and texting family members and friends.</p>\n<p>With Vito at his side, Michael Jr. had been asked what was the most difficult part of coming out. He told the interviewer that it was telling his friends. Michael Sr. was incensed.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf it was so hard to tell his friends, why didn‚Äôt he tell us first?‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was harder for him to tell us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And it probably was. One recent afternoon, Michael Sr.‚Äôs brother Charles asked if Michael Jr. might go back to women. Michael Sr. responded, ‚ÄúWomen don‚Äôt really want to mess with you after doing all that gay shit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. is never going to be the spokesman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. He‚Äôs not thrilled about his son‚Äôs sexual orientation. But he also hasn‚Äôt disowned his son. He never says his son is going to hell. He doesn‚Äôt talk about trying to cure him or make him straight. In his own rough-hewn, coarse way, Michael Sr. has accepted that his son is gay. ‚ÄúI love my son,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt care about what he do.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243564\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243564','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Buckner / Getty Images For ESPYS</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The family rift that the ESPY Awards exposed to a national audience had been there, deep and wide, for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243442\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 302px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243442','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Will Ebner </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://L.G\">L.G</a>.

Instead of asking his family to attend as guests, he invited the family of Missouri football teammate Will Ebner.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe found out Will and I were going to be part of his family representing him,‚Äù said Elaine Ebner, mother of Will Ebner. ‚ÄúIf someone else had come from his family, I would have wanted them to be center stage.

Everyone in the family ‚Äî except Josh and Chris, who were both in jail ‚Äî made the 600-mile road trip from Texas to celebrate the first of JoAnn‚Äôs and Michael Sr.‚Äôs children to graduate from college.</p>\n<p>To commemorate the occasion, Michael Jr. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/h6w1JOG8Zk/?modal=true\">posted a picture on Instagram</a> of himself in a cap and gown, a wide smile on his face and an elbow comfortably resting on the mantle of a fireplace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming,‚Äù read his caption. He was alone in the photo and made no mention of anyone else being there ‚Äî in that or any of his other public social media posts from the time.</p>\n<p>Later in December, during the week of the Cotton Bowl in Dallas ‚Äî Michael Jr.‚Äôs final college game ‚Äî Michael Sr. said his son borrowed his car and spent all of his time with Vito and teammates. Michael Sr. also said his son lied to him about the location of the team hotel and then didn‚Äôt call him, or return any of his calls, for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had to call him to get him to bring me my car back,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI kept calling and calling. He didn‚Äôt bring the car until the last day, and the game was the next day. He didn‚Äôt talk to me or nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In May, on the weekend of the NFL draft, Michael Jr.‚Äôs family was conspicuously absent when TV cameras followed him around at his agent‚Äôs home in San Diego. He declined an offer from his father‚Äôs family members to attend a draft party they wanted to host in Dallas, his aunt Geraldine and Michael Sr. said. Instead, he spent the weekend in California with Vito, some friends, and his agents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs so ashamed of us,‚Äù Geraldine remembers one of his sisters telling her, ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt he just change his name?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The day the Rams drafted him ‚Äî when he was so happy that he kissed Vito and smeared his face with celebratory cake ‚Äî might end up being the pinnacle of Michael Jr.‚Äôs NFL career. Now, cut from his second team, he is learning something his father learned long ago: Life can take what you want most.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, <i>Outsports</i> noted, every single Defensive Player of the Year from the five major college football conferences made it onto an NFL team ‚Äî except Michael Sam Jr. And it‚Äôs not that he played poorly in preseason. Far from it. He totaled 11 tackles and three sacks, a figure that left him tied for fourth in the league. His bold announcement of his sexuality, which garnered him glamorous accolades, may have also destroyed his football career.</p>\n<p>Disappointment and loss are feelings Michael Sr. knows well, of course, so the two Michaels have more in common now than they may have ever had. And yet Michael Jr. doesn‚Äôt come to his father ‚Äî or anyone in his family ‚Äî for comfort. He keeps his distance.</p>\n<p>To Michael Sr., sitting in his wheelchair or taking a drag on one of his Kools, that distance can feel like death. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose another son.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243647\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"441\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 393px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243647','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 11:47:15.959647"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/the-two-michael-sams"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-15738-1415729730-34.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-13"], ["title", "The Two Michael¬†Sams"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 11:47:15.959647"]]

For his crime, Robert Braxton Jr. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">served</a> two years in prison.</p>\n<p>In court, prosecutors presented no evidence that Hall herself had harmed the child. But for failing to intervene against Braxton‚Äôs abuse, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">was sentenced</a> to 30 years behind bars.</p>\n<p>Her tough sentence was meted out despite evidence that Braxton had also been violently abusing her. In statements to authorities <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">out</a> of court, and in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News, Hall described Braxton choking her, punching her, throwing things at her, and verbally assaulting her. Even the judge who sentenced her <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">said</a> that during her testimony, Hall seemed to fear her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Hall is one of 28 mothers in 11 states who a recent <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/how-the-law-turns-battered-women-into-criminals#1u8oxdk\">BuzzFeed News investigation</a> found were sentenced to 10 years or more for failing to protect their children. In <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">every one</a> of these cases, there was evidence the mother herself had been violently abused by the man. Hall is one of three cases BuzzFeed News found in which the mother got <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">a longer sentence</a> than the man who actually abused the child.</p>\n<p>Braxton walked free eight years ago, having been <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">let go for time served</a>. Meanwhile, Hall has been locked up in an all-female prison in McLoud, Oklahoma. She said that she has seen her children only once since she went to prison but that they write each other monthly. In letters shared with BuzzFeed News, the children tell her about sports, school, and clothes. They make reference to her case, too. ‚ÄúI hope God Let‚Äôs [sic] you out of jail,‚Äù one letter says.</p>\n<p>Hall has been trying to get her sentence reduced. She currently has <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=542749&amp;offender_book_id=323174\">20 years left</a> behind bars. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed but lost</a>, and the trial judge in her case has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied a request</a> to modify her sentence. She will not be eligible for parole until 2030.</p>\n<p>But she is pursuing one last hope: clemency. Earlier this month, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html\">applied</a> for her sentence to be commuted ‚Äî which would release her while not absolving her of her crime.</p>\n<p>In the wake of BuzzFeed News‚Äô original investigation, a women‚Äôs rights organization <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/meet-the-abuse-victim-who-got-30-years-in-prison-and-the-fem\">took up Hall‚Äôs cause</a>, creating an <a href=\"http://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/tondalo_hall/?source=uv_website\">online petition</a> to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. ‚ÄúTondalo Hall shouldn‚Äôt be in prison while the man who abused her and her children is free,‚Äù wrote <a href=\"http://www.weareultraviolet.org/\">UltraViolet</a>, a group that claims nearly 600,000 members nationwide. On Tuesday, an UltraViolet official said that more than 44,000 people had signed the petition since it was first circulated on Nov. 6.</p>\n<p>In Oklahoma, a pardon or commutation cannot be granted without the approval of the state‚Äôs parole board. It is unclear when the parole board will make a decision on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n<p>Hall herself almost missed the deadline to apply for a commutation. In Oklahoma, only inmates with 20 or more years left on their sentences can apply. When she mailed her application, Hall had 20 years and five days left behind bars.</p>\n<p>Another Oklahoma mother, Alishia Mackey, also received a longer sentence than the abuser, and the victim, her son, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">believes she should be free</a>. But Mackey has 10 years left on <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=489054&amp;offender_book_id=286204\">her sentence</a>, so she is ineligible for a commutation.</p>\n<p>The parole board declined to comment on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231377\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"438\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 390px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall, Oklahoma Department of Corrections</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Some prosecutors defend the long sentences given to battered women who don‚Äôt intervene to stop their children from being harmed as sending a message that mothers have a duty to protect their children, even if they must risk their own safety. But many domestic violence advocates women counter that such punishments blame the victim and demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of what it means for women to be trapped in abusive relationships. Such women often fear alerting authorities because doing so can provoke their partners to extreme violence and because the authorities often fail to protect battered women and their children.</p>\n<p>Hall, who dropped out of high school in 10th grade, told BuzzFeed News that she met Braxton in either 2000 or 2001, when she would have been between 15 and 17. They soon began dating, and Braxton, who is two years older than Hall, seemed ambitious and nice ‚Äî in the beginning.</p>\n<p>She can‚Äôt quite remember what it was that set him off the first time: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell him where I went, or something,‚Äù she recalled. They got into an argument, she said, and he punched her in the face.</p>\n<p>He apologized, she recalled, and said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, and it didn‚Äôt, for a while at least. But then, during another argument, this time when she was pregnant, he put his hands around her throat. ‚ÄúHe told me that my mouth was too smart,‚Äù she would later <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p55/a186122\">testify in court</a>. With her head on the seat of the blue couch in her apartment, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">he choked her</a>.</p>\n<p>The abuse, both physical and verbal, picked up once her third child (and second with Braxton) was born in August 2004, Hall told BuzzFeed News. He isolated her from her loved ones, driving ‚Äúa wedge between me and my family,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">summed up</a> the alleged abuse in her commutation application: ‚ÄúRobert regularly choked me, blackened my eyes, threw objects at me and verbally assaulted me, while my children were in the home.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Hall‚Äôs friend Gayla Watts-Sparger noticed changes in Hall and her children. Watts-Sparger has known Hall since kindergarten and said Hall was always goofy and outgoing. ‚ÄúYou know how you meet somebody, and everything they say is funny?‚Äù Watts-Sparger said.</p>\n<p>But after Hall moved in with Braxton, Hall became ‚Äúa lot quieter,‚Äù Watts-Sparger said, and Hall‚Äôs children acted strange too. Watts-Sparger recalled seeing Hall‚Äôs son, who was maybe a year old at the time, sitting upright and very still for a young child. When Braxton came by, Watts-Sparger said, the young boy would flinch.</p>\n<p>Reached through his Facebook account, Braxton at first said he would speak with BuzzFeed News but then did not respond to subsequent messages. After BuzzFeed News left repeated voicemails and sent a detailed letter to Braxton‚Äôs address given in court papers, a woman identifying herself as ‚ÄúMs. Braxton‚Äù called and said that Robert Braxton does not live there and that she doesn‚Äôt know where he is.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2004, Hall said, she noticed that her 20-month-old son‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p45/a186123\">leg was swollen</a>. Braxton told her he didn‚Äôt know what might have happened. The problem persisted for several days, so she brought the boy to the hospital.</p>\n<p>Doctors determined <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186124\">he had</a> a fractured femur and other broken bones. Suspecting child abuse, authorities checked on Hall and Braxton‚Äôs 3-month-old daughter, and found similar injuries. Both Hall and Braxton were arrested.</p>\n<p>Detectives at the Oklahoma City Police Department brought them both into the same interview room. Before the interrogation, Braxton <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p77/a186125\">was heard whispering to Hall</a>, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">initially told</a> the police that she had hurt their son by throwing him on the bed as they were playing ‚Äî a version she later said was a lie. After Braxton admitted he had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355439-braxton-tells-detective-that-he-squeezed-his.html#document/p1/a186129\">squeezed his baby daughter too tightly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186128\">cranked her leg</a>, detectives <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186476\">concluded</a> that he was the one who had injured both children, not her.</p>\n<p>Hall remained in jail, though. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p17/a186108\">pled guilty</a> to enabling child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. She agreed to testify against Braxton ‚Äî though she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">did not receive a deal</a> from prosecutors for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p>Braxton took his case to trial. Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186131\">wrote</a> in her commutation application that Braxton ‚Äúrepeatedly threatened me‚Äù during their initial court hearings. ‚ÄúFor example, when Robert and I were being shuttled to and from court he would terrorize me. He would tell me that I would spend the rest of my life in prison and he would be out with our children.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Still, Hall agreed to testify against him. During Braxton‚Äôs trial, she was the main witness who could have seen Braxton actually harming the children. Yet Hall could not point to any specific abuse that she witnessed ‚Äî because, she told BuzzFeed News, she didn‚Äôt actually see any abuse happen. In court, she also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p46/a186139\">couldn‚Äôt recall</a> the date her son began having trouble walking.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Angela Marsee grew frustrated that Hall was not providing enough testimony to nail Braxton. ‚ÄúWhat do you know?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186136\">she asked</a>.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186140\">replied</a> that she had once woken up to hear that her daughter was screaming. Braxton had been changing the girl‚Äôs diaper. He told her nothing was wrong and that she should go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">asked for more</a>. ‚ÄúWas there anything else that happened in your apartment that gave you reason to know that your children were in danger at the hands of this defendant?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Hall replied. That‚Äôs when she began to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">describe</a> the time that Braxton had choked her, when she was pregnant. Yet Braxton‚Äôs lawyer <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p57/a186142\">objected</a> to this line of questioning, saying it was not relevant to the child abuse charge against him. The judge sided with Braxton.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186144\">wanted</a> life in prison for Braxton, sensed that their case against him <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">was crumbling</a>. With the trial in recess, the state and the defense worked out a deal. Braxton pled guilty but <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p11/a186106\">admitted</a> to having harmed only one child.

Investigators interviewed Hall, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">declared</a> that Braxton had been abusive. They also interviewed Hall‚Äôs cousin, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186148\">took custody of her three children</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">According to the report</a>, the cousin stated that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186157\">was a good mother</a> but that Braxton was very controlling, kept Hall away from her family, and did not want the boys to be kissed or hugged because doing so would make them a ‚Äúpunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The report noted that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186151\">was</a> 22 years old, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186149\">had no prior arrests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186150\">suffered</a> from depression.

If released to probation, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186152\">the officers said</a>, ‚ÄúShe would be supervised as a low-level offender.‚Äù Marsee, the prosecutor in both the Braxton and Hall cases, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p22/a186109\">said in court</a> that she had no issues with any of the facts in the report.</p>\n<p>Hall‚Äôs sentencing hearing began <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p20\">on Dec. 20, 2006</a>, two weeks <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p13/a186153\">after</a> Braxton was released.

So she should not benefit from that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In response, Hall‚Äôs attorney Bill Smith pointed to the choking incident. ‚ÄúShe was scared of Robert Braxton,‚Äù Smith <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186112\">told the court</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p28/a186155\">asked</a> that she receive the same sentence as Braxton.</p>\n<p>When it came time for Judge Ray Elliott to announce his decision, he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">told the courtroom</a> that he had noticed some things about Hall‚Äôs testimony. After certain questions, Hall would ‚Äúmake direct eye contact‚Äù with Braxton before ‚Äútaking a moment or two to respond.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat tells me something, based on my years of experience,‚Äù Elliott said. But this did not excuse her. ‚ÄúWas she scared of him? Probably,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, again, even weighing that factor into the equation I‚Äôm of the opinion she was less than candid.‚Äù He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">sentenced her</a> to 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was speechless,‚Äù said Hall‚Äôs friend, Watts-Sparger, when she heard the news. ‚ÄúAll I could do was cry.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed</a> her sentence to a three-judge panel and lost, though a dissenting judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html#document/p5/a186127\">declared</a> that she was a ‚Äúpoor, pathetic young woman with three young children who was involved in an abusive relationship.‚Äù She filed another petition that asked Elliott, the trial judge, to modify her sentence<b>.</b> He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied it</a>, because too much time had elapsed so he no longer had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Elliott told BuzzFeed News that he didn‚Äôt have any recollection of the details of the case ‚Äî it was too long ago for him to remember. Still, he said, ‚ÄúI feel very comfortable with my decision, because I take every decision seriously.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Smith, Hall‚Äôs attorney, also said he couldn‚Äôt remember the specifics of the case. Marsee, the prosecutor, told BuzzFeed News that she, like Hall, felt that Braxton‚Äôs prison term was far too short. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to tell you how frustrated I was with that whole situation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfortunate.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But the fact that she was scared does not absolve her of her duty as a mother. ‚ÄúHer sentence is appropriate for what she allowed him to do to her children,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey lived in pain because of what she did not stop.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231518\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"470\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 422px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231518','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now Hall awaits the result of her commutation request.</p>\n<p>The author of the law under which Hall was convicted serves as the interim executive director of the parole board. Jari Askins was an Oklahoma state representative in 2000 when she wrote a bill that created the crime of ‚Äúenabling child abuse,‚Äù with the word ‚Äúenabling‚Äù meant to drive home that a failure to act was enough to warrant prosecution.</p>\n<p>Her law makes Oklahoma one of at least 29 states that explicitly criminalize parents‚Äô failure to protect their children from abuse. Prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws, such as ones against placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>Askins, whose long career in public service includes stints as a judge and lieutenant governor, told BuzzFeed News that she is sensitive to the plight of battered women. When her law was being considered, she said, she and her fellow legislators didn‚Äôt contemplate that it might help imprison women who themselves had been victimized by their partners. As executive director, she does not vote on clemency requests. Speaking generally, not of Hall‚Äôs case, she said that being battered is a mitigating circumstance that defendants could raise at trial.</p>\n<p>In her application for clemency, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186434\">wrote</a> that the opposite happened. ‚ÄúI believe that my testimony detailing the violence in our home was used against me,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúRather than being protected by the State, I was prosecuted.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p10/a186435\">expressed remorse</a> for not getting her children out of the home sooner: ‚ÄúI had a duty to protect my children and I failed.‚Äù But, she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186156\">wrote</a>, ‚ÄúI was trapped in an abusive relationship and I feared that alerting authorities would provoke Robert to increase his violence.‚Äù She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">said</a> she also feared that Braxton would gain custody of her children. ‚ÄúMy decisions, although detrimental to my family, were made out of fear rather than rationality.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Since she got to prison, Hall has completed her GED and taken parenting classes. She holds down a job in the laundry department. And she writes letters to her children, the youngest of whom is now 10. They write her back maybe once a month or so, she said, telling her how they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre up to.</p>\n<p>The letters update Hall on how grades are going, when spring break is approaching, what the word perimeter means. The children talk about riding bikes and what presents Santa might bring. Some feature drawings. One has two stick figures, with the person on the left labeled ‚Äúme‚Äù and the person on the right labeled ‚Äúyou.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One letter tells Hall that about some new shoes and a favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. It also asks her a question:</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy did my Father break my leg, and ribs? I love you.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231654\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"677\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 629px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231654','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Email the reporter at alex.campbell@buzzfeed.com</i></p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 11:47:34.914350"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-7653-1415738459-12.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-12"], ["title", "This Battered Woman Wants To Get Out Of¬†Prison"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 11:47:34.914350"]]

If <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and its brand of thoughtful, empathetic, addictive drama has morphed into a quasi-religion, then Tami Taylor is its patron saint, the complicated embodiment of all that made the show feel different and real and smart.</p>\n<p>The character of Tami Taylor lived for 76 episodes and five seasons ‚Äî long enough for her character to subsume the actress who played her. Even in her subsequent starring roles in <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>Nashville</i> feel like she‚Äôs just following a different path on the Tami Taylor Choose Your Adventure novel: In one, her marriage falls apart and she ends up having sex with a man in a rubber suit; in another, she becomes a famous country singer with a complicated love life. But the center ‚Äî the Tami Taylor-ified charisma, the waterfall of hair, and the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about you, do we need to have a talk‚Äù face ‚Äî remains.</p>\n<p>The fortitude and consistency of that center has fostered an adult cult of Connie Britton: a mass of women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 45, who view Britton not just with affection, or awe, but admiration. Every star has fans, but select few have cults. We often associate the word ‚Äúcult‚Äù with mindless, manipulated masses, but the word also connotes a group whose beliefs are in some way deviant or different. If Britton had become a star during those <i>Spin City</i> years, there‚Äôd be nothing cultish about loving her: Like so many other sitcom stars, she was somewhere around 30, thin, white, beautiful, straight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212612\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:description=\"Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:17\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:17\" rel:count=\"2\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal. She‚Äôs still thin, white, beautiful, and straight, but she‚Äôs the thing that the vast majority of mainstream media pretends doesn‚Äôt exist: a woman over 40. More specifically, a woman over 40 whose image combines the sexual <i>and</i> the maternal, the ambitious <i>and</i> the empathetic. As one fan of the hundreds who, when solicited, offered testimonials about why they loved Britton told me, ‚ÄúShe makes getting older seem incredibly appealing ‚Äî not just because she looks stunning, but it‚Äôs the sense of presence and surety she projects.‚Äù The combination of confidence and beauty, of wisdom and maturity ‚Äî that‚Äôs what undergirds her fandom.</p>\n<p>At this moment, the seeming singularity of Connie Britton, and the magnitude of the affection directed toward her, bespeaks a generalized hunger for a female star that models a nuanced, mature, and periodically imperfect form of femininity. It‚Äôs about the hair, of course ‚Äî which has taken on a near totemic function ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also about much more than that.</p>\n<p>Britton is by no means the biggest star in Hollywood: <i>Nashville</i> is limping through its third season, and she was on screen for all of 10 minutes in her most recent film, <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>. But if you look closely, she might be one of the most important. Hollywood didn‚Äôt make Connie Britton a star, cobbling together the most reductive and regressive notions of what it means to be a woman today. We did, forging her in the most hopeful and realistic yet strong versions of our best selves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212500\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212500','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Tommaso Boddi / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The narrative of Britton‚Äôs early career has been recited in the various profiles of her post-<i>Friday Night Lights</i> fame. She grew up fairly WASP-y in Maryland and Virginia, went to Dartmouth, majored in Asian Studies, studied abroad with (now Sen.) Kirsten Gillibrand. She‚Äôd been involved in theater in high school and, after graduating from college, moved to New York and married her college boyfriend, and while he became a finance banker, she dabbled in off-off-Broadway productions while taking part-time jobs to help pay the bills, including one as an aerobics instructor, leg warmers and all. (Britton declined to be interviewed for this story.)</p>\n<p>Britton and the finance husband divorced in 1995, but at that point she had spent eight months shooting the film that would put her, however briefly, on the map as the frustrated wife of an adulterous man in Ed Burns‚Äô debut feature, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, a small character study with a tiny budget that went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.</p>\n<p><i>McMullen</i> didn‚Äôt make Britton a household name, but it did put her on casting directors‚Äô radar, which is how she nearly won the <i>Jerry Maguire</i> role that eventually went to Renee Zellweger.</p>\n<p>Two paths diverged in a Hollywood casting room: One star (Zellweger) became a household name, while the other went on to a string of sitcoms. The <i>Maguire</i> role would have made Britton into a late-‚Äò90s It Girl, but one look at the current state of Zellweger‚Äôs career ‚Äî and the current uproar over daring to age and/or her resistance to it ‚Äî and you can see why Britton should be thankful to have missed the chance to make out with Tom Cruise.</p>\n<p>Instead of <i>Maguire</i>, Britton found herself cast in a slew of doomed pilots and in a multi-episode stint on the original <i>Ellen</i> as the overbearing, clueless sister of one of Ellen‚Äôs best friends, and eventually landed the role of Nikki on <i>Spin City</i>, where she would win the sort of quiet following that often follows supporting sitcom characters.</p>\n<p>But when Fox‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs disease forced him to leave <i>Spin City</i> in 2000, Britton‚Äôs character was written off the show. For the next six years, she jumped from one small role to the next, sometimes picking up a recurring gig, as she did in <i>The West Wing</i>, other times ending up a piece of ‚Äò80s-costumed window dressing, as she did in the film adaptation of Buzz Bissinger‚Äôs <i>Friday Night Lights</i> in 2004. It was an exhausting, frustrating schlep between sets and roles and disappointments.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Peter Berg, who had produced the film version of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, was working on a television adaptation for NBC that would be far more loosely based on the real-life events collected in Bissinger‚Äôs book. He asked Britton to reprise the same role she had played in the film, promising that this time, her role would be more fleshed out. ‚ÄúI was really, really hesitant,‚Äù Britton told <i>Variety.</i> ‚ÄúIn fact, I said, ‚ÄòNo. I love you and adore you, but I don‚Äôt want to.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet Berg reiterated his promise for something bigger and meatier than a meekly supportive coach‚Äôs wife ‚Äî and it was that role, as guidance counselor, mother, wife, and eventually principal, that would, over the course of five seasons, turn Connie Britton into the household name that she nearly became more than a decade before. She wasn‚Äôt a buxom young starlet or the hottest new thing; she was just, quite simply and clearly, one of television‚Äôs best actresses in one of its most complicated roles.</p>\n<p>The details of Britton‚Äôs struggle ultimately matter less than the sheer fact of a woman breaking through in Hollywood at the age of 39. But that‚Äôs just one of the qualities of Britton‚Äôs image that have made it so pervasively popular over the last eight years. For men and women alike, she exudes what feels like an amorphous, complex feminine aura. But ask any woman to tease that apart and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs an amalgamation of several interlocking areas: softness, maturity, progressiveness, and a particular take on ‚Äúhaving it all.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212371\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 852px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212371','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Loccisano / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù isn‚Äôt to do with Britton‚Äôs body ‚Äî which is pilates-toned, but by no means a size zero ‚Äî so much as her demeanor. And the way we understand Britton‚Äôs demeanor is as an extension of Tami Taylor, who spent five seasons negotiating her way to power from the stereotypically subservient position of ‚Äúcoach‚Äôs wife‚Äù in a football-obsessed town.</p>\n<p>Instead of forcefully critiquing the cultural infrastructure from the outside, she works within its existing boundaries to change it. Her beauty, her smile, that nice-lady voice, all of it is a way of getting what she/the high school students she counsels want or need, especially when dealing with apparatuses of power (the boosters, the school board, Joe McCoy). She kills not with kindness, but with <a href=\"http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihYkEAQ_DY\">y‚Äôalls</a>.</p>\n<p>Tami‚Äôs power is negotiated, but it‚Äôs also a realistic rendering of how women in much of America are able to fight and win battles on a daily basis. Instead of busting balls, attempting to engage in conversation. Instead of insulting another‚Äôs way of life, trying to inhabit it. Tami‚Äôs mix of the soft Southern exterior with steely drive emulates a form of activism wholly recognizable to anyone who‚Äôs attempted to effect change in an environment wholly resistant to it.</p>\n<p>That Tami Taylor brand of softness is replicated in Britton‚Äôs off-screen persona. No matter that Britton isn‚Äôt exactly a native Southerner: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conniebritton\">Her Twitter account</a> is littered with y‚Äôalls. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that Britton is performing ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù; rather, it‚Äôs become a naturally accentuated component of her public persona. It‚Äôs amplified every time an interviewer asks her to recreate the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of Tami Taylor ‚Äî getting her to don Taylor‚Äôs signature aviators, for example ‚Äî and underlined in her leading role in <i>Nashville</i>, in which she might say fewer ‚Äúy‚Äôalls‚Äù but still embraces the same model of conciliatory power and strength, this time with more glitter and halter tops. The softness ‚Äî and its power to persuade ‚Äî endures. And of course, on screen and off, with its soft waves, its welcoming caramel color, there‚Äôs the hair.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Britton, the first thing they talk about is the hair. Even in professional interviews, journalists ask her about it. Seth Meyers pegged <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj7nBKUXg8\">an entire segment</a> to it. The Britton cover story in <i>More</i> magazine begins with, ‚ÄúThe hair is tawny, thick, and tousled to casual perfection. And it‚Äôs all her own.‚Äù <i>American Horror Story</i> showrunner Ryan Murphy says, ‚ÄúShe has the best hair in Hollywood.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs the hair-supported <a href=\"about:blank\">Tumblr</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConBritsHair\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/magazine/video/how-to-connie-britton-waves\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/connie-britton-hair-how-to-tutorial-hairstyle-I535890\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvt3QU7Z-8k\">tutorials</a>.</p>\n<p>The hair connotes softness, but it also suggests a sort of unfettered, unabashed womanliness. It‚Äôs not just the volume ‚Äî although that‚Äôs part of it ‚Äî or the beautiful color. It‚Äôs not even the hair itself so much as what it‚Äôs not: namely, the stereotypical haircut of a fortysomething mother, doomed to the next four decades of practical mom-cuts.</p>\n<p>As cultural critics Sarah Blackwood and Sarah Mesle <a href=\"http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2012/10/16/on-connie-brittons-hair/\">put it</a>, ‚ÄúThe Hair asks us to think about a heavy ponytail at 40. Let‚Äôs not dismiss this as a joke, or as the same question as Botox or artificially plumped lips. If Botox is always about youth obsession, Connie Britton‚Äôs Hair is not always ‚Äî or even ever ‚Äî an attempt to look like Lyla Garrity or Hayden Panettiere. It might actually be about the specific pleasure of forty-ness.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The utter fullness of the hair is like a testament to a life well-lived. The strawberry blonde highlights suggest a life spent in the sun; its ability to swing in a ponytail, to rope up in a French twist, tousle around the shoulders, even to look just this side of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jbf%20hair\">J.B.F</a>., is like an extension of all the modes of femininity occupied by today‚Äôs accomplished woman.</p>\n<p>Britton‚Äôs hair refuses to hew the line of what a woman‚Äôs hair (or life) should resemble. It‚Äôs not unruly the way that, say, Helena Bonham Carter‚Äôs hair is ‚Äî but it declares, through its sheer existence, a different self-conception for a woman over 40 than those proffered by the media. The hair, in other words, feels like a revelation.</p>\n<p>But if we‚Äôre talking about Connie Britton‚Äôs hair, we‚Äôre also talking about the way it complements her face. Usually people say that a face ‚Äúbetrays‚Äù one‚Äôs age, but Britton‚Äôs face functions as the opposite of betrayal: Each smile line and crow‚Äôs-foot makes her somehow more, not <i>less</i>, beautiful. She‚Äôs not old; she‚Äôs <i>mature</i>. And with that maturity comes a certain wisdom: the ability, for example, to discuss big, often alienating issues with grace and empathy, whether it‚Äôs talking to her teenage daughter about losing her virginity (<i>Friday Night Lights</i>) or figuring out how to admit that her marriage is over (<i>Nashville</i>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212609\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:description=\"Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3505101_4212609\" rel:via=\"annehelen\" rel:sub_title=\"Usually%20male%20stars%20are%20the%20ones%20who%20grow%20into%20their%20looks%20‚Äî\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:16\" rel:count=\"5\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs no coincidence that Britton worked in Hollywood for decades before breaking through. She was always beautiful, but it wasn‚Äôt until she looked the way she does now that beauty became one of her defining adjectives. Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant ‚Äî but most female stars peak and often became hyperreal versions of their former selves, an amalgam of precise surgery and injections.</p>\n<p>In this way, Britton‚Äôs refusal to transform her face becomes an act of rebellion against a system of norms that would rather she freeze all movement above her eyebrows than have a visible wrinkle. But Britton has also consciously refused to bend her narrative into that of a woman obsessed with her own aging. As she told <i>Esquire</i>, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really focused on myself as a quote-unquote ‚Äòwoman maturing.‚Äô I try to avoid that at all costs. ‚Ä¶ Some of the press that happened around <i>Nashville</i> really was an eye-opener for me, because there were a lot of initial stories describing my character as ‚Äòaging‚Äô and ‚Äòover the hill,‚Äô and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck?‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Originally, Britton‚Äôs <i>Nashville</i> character was framed as the aging has-been to Hayden Panettiere‚Äôs Taylor Swift-esque ingenue, but Britton hated the dichotomy. She fought the writers to cut scenes, like one planned for the premiere, in which she did the stereotypical pull-at-your-face-and-look-sad routine. She was ‚Äúfurious‚Äù about the trajectory of her character, especially, as Britton explained, given what had recently happened in her own career: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even who I represent as an actor,‚Äù she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <i>New York Times.</i> ‚ÄúMy life started being awesome five years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>To admit that life can, indeed, start to be awesome at 40 ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great quote.

We can safely assume that the rest of their small Texas town almost certainly votes Republican, but the narrative never hinges on questions of political affinity. Rather, it divides on lines of haves and have-nots, of who advocates for which side and with what motivation. Tami Taylor might not label herself a liberal, but she‚Äôs an unequivocal progressive, working on the micro scale to rectify macro-level divisions of class, race, and gender.</p>\n<p>The most prominent example manifests in the form of Taylor‚Äôs counsel to Becky, a 16-year-old who becomes pregnant the first time she has sex. When Becky asks Tami how she‚Äôd advise her own daughter in the same situation, Tami‚Äôs response is a master class in ethical counsel: ‚ÄúI would tell her to think about her life, think about what‚Äôs important to her and what she wants, and I would tell her that she‚Äôs in a real tough spot, and then I would support whatever decision she made.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The episode received a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/arts/television/10lights.html\">significant</a> <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2010/07/12/friday-night-lights-takes-on-abortion/\">amount</a> <a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2010/02/04/friday-night-lights-abortion-plotline-mustsee-tv/\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/07/friday-night-lights-tackles-abortion/59495/\">attention</a>, in part because it was the first to directly address abortion on broadcast television since, well, <i>Maude,</i> nearly three decades before. But it‚Äôs but one of dozens of ways in which Taylor‚Äôs character models a progressive social view: the way she advocates for, and achieves, an equal partnership with her husband; her handling of the revelation of the mayor‚Äôs lesbianism; the best sex talk in television history; her overarching and persistent advocacy for Tyra in all parts of her life. You could say that Tami‚Äôs just doing her job as a guidance counselor, but she‚Äôs doing her job in a deeply humanistic way that‚Äôs implicitly, if not explicitly, in line with the aims of social justice.</p>\n<p>Tami is outspoken and candid, never didactic or preachy. It‚Äôs the way, really, so many of us imagine our best activist selves: not as actors in some hyperpoliticized arena, but as good people helping and doing and advising not because of some overarching ideology, but because it seems right.</p>\n<p>If Tami Taylor is the primary narrative agent of social justice in <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, then it makes sense that the aura of progressivism clings to Britton‚Äôs image outside of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>. But Britton‚Äôs own actions have only strengthened the conflation of Taylor‚Äôs work with her ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù beliefs. When the Mitt Romney campaign started using the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> catchphrase ‚ÄúClear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can‚Äôt Lose,‚Äù Britton shot back, penning an <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/28/women-birth-control-friday-night-lights/1663895/\">editorial</a> for <i>USA Today</i> arguing that Romney‚Äôs stance on birth control was counter to the central tenets of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i> During Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis‚Äô filibuster to block a restrictive antiabortion bill, Britton not only proclaimed her support, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/connie-britton-lisa-edelstein-support-578118\">but released a limited-edition T-shirt</a> inscribed with ‚ÄúWhat Would Tami Taylor Do?‚Äù (<a href=\"http://standwithtexaswomen.org\">standwithtexaswomen.org</a> on the back) with all proceeds directed to Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Britton, like Taylor ‚Äî and like the stated doctrine of Planned Parenthood ‚Äî is not advocating for abortion, but for <i>choice</i>. But even that sort of advocacy would be too much of a polarizing issue for most celebrities to touch. It‚Äôs OK to support a political candidate, but a divisive issue like abortion, that‚Äôs something else entirely.</p>\n<p>But if Britton‚Äôs willingness to attach herself to the issue of reproductive rights might have alienated a minority of fans, it served to fortify the support of the majority and solidify the cult. Even as it‚Äôs become increasingly accepted for celebrities to identify as feminists, few speak specifically about what that means, in action ‚Äî in part, of course, to avoid losing fans or potential projects. Britton‚Äôs vocal support of feminist candidates and causes makes her advocacy seem less strategic, performative, or planned and more of an extension of a ‚Äútrue‚Äù self and belief system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212608\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212608','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Rick Diamond / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a woman to ‚Äúhave it all,‚Äù she must, in some vague, unspecific terms, manage to simultaneously satisfy her boss, her children, and her partner; then, and only then, can she can be satisfied herself. And beautiful, and adhering to generalized body norms, and emotionally and spiritually fulfilled. As many have argued, ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù is just the ideal set forth by a postfeminist ideology in which all women should be all things to all people, with little mind to how it negates and evacuates the self.</p>\n<p>Britton‚Äôs image, with its resounding echoes of Tami Taylor, offers a different take on the ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù scenario. As one half of what has been called ‚Äú<a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/04/11/greatest-tv-couple-staff-pick-friday-night-lights/\">the greatest TV couple of all time</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/friday-night-lights-finale-how-the-best-marriage-on-tv-was-created/70996/\">the best marriage on television</a>,‚Äù Britton ‚Äî along with co-star Kyle Chandler ‚Äî models a relationship that‚Äôs an actual partnership. It‚Äôs imperfect, it‚Äôs filled with strife, but unlike most television dramas, which pivot on the question of when and how a couple will end up cheating on each other, Britton and Chandler decided that potential infidelity would never be the guiding question of their on-screen relationship.</p>\n<p>Rather, the narrative focuses on how two ambitious, focused individuals do their best to keep loving each other ‚Äî and their daughters ‚Äî and still do the things that make them feel like worthwhile, accomplished humans. It‚Äôs never perfect: The house is never clean, Baby Gracie is often lugged around in confusion, teenage Julie is pissed a lot, and there is a modicum of white wine in every episode, but it feels like a lived-in, loving partnership, something to which a couple can aspire, rather than a way of judging their deficiencies. And the message of the series finale ‚Äî in which Tami tells Eric that it‚Äôs her turn to let her career guide the trajectory of their lives ‚Äî is also the most radical way for a show about a football team to wrap up, ever, the end.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù of <i>FNL</i> is having some of all the things that matter to you, and finding value and validation in doing the best you‚Äôre able at those chosen things. You see the same philosophy modeled in <i>Nashville</i>, in which Britton‚Äôs character manages to juggle a career, two daughters, a collapsing marriage, an alcoholic love-of-her-life, and multiple new suitors, while also serving as a mentor to younger artists and starting her own record label. Rayna James doesn‚Äôt do any of those things perfectly, but she does them ‚Äî and refuses to apologize for that seeming lack of perfection.</p>\n<p>At the heart of both characters is a complexity, and an eagerness to balance a multiplicity of identities, that Britton herself has pushed for. On <i>Friday Nights Lights,</i> her attention to her character‚Äôs trajectory was described as ‚Äúrabid‚Äù; for her turn in <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>, she refused to allow the role of a woman dating a man two decades her junior to degenerate into that of a ‚Äúcougar.‚Äù When <i>Fast Company</i> <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3009149/most-creative-people-2013/13-connie-britton\">named</a> her as No. 13 of the ‚Äú100 Most Creative People In Business,‚Äù she outlined the strategy she‚Äôs adopted for ‚Äúowning‚Äù a character: With each script, she goes through the dialogue line by line, working with <i>Nashville</i> showrunner Callie Khouri to identify ‚Äúlines that don‚Äôt feel right‚Äù for the character of Rayna.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not difficult to understand, then, why so many ambitious women find themselves drawn to Britton and the women she‚Äôs played on screen: As one fan explained to me, ‚ÄúTami and Rayna totally captivate me because they‚Äôre each deeply OK with themselves, and that‚Äôs the source of their power.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That sort of deep ‚ÄúOK-ness‚Äù extends to Britton‚Äôs personal life, in which she‚Äôs balanced a career with the duties of single motherhood (she adopted a son, Yobi, from Ethiopia in 2011), advocacy, and even sex. Friend and producer Sarah Aubrey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told</a> the <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i> magazine that ‚Äúin my experience of watching Connie Britton‚Äôs dating life, it has not been Connie getting beaten out by 25-year-old girls, let‚Äôs leave it at that.‚Äù Or, in Britton‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put it this way: The older you get, the easier it is to date younger men. There are more of them.‚Äù Britton‚Äôs been linked with comedian Jason Mantzoukas, but unlike contemporaries Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz, whose love lives play out in the headlines, framed as fruitless searches for domestic bliss, Britton has kept her love life (and, presumably, really hot younger boyfriends) out of the limelight.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Britton acknowledges how difficult single parenthood is ‚Äî but also how privileged she is to have assistance. ‚ÄúOur hours [as actors] are long,‚Äù Britton <a href=\"http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/connie-britton-interview#slide-1\">told</a> <i>Redbook</i>, ‚Äúbut I would never compare what I do with what anyone else does. Everybody‚Äôs working hard and doing the best they can ‚Äî if you‚Äôre a mom, there‚Äôs that pressure, we all face it. I‚Äôm constantly being pulled in different directions. But that‚Äôs the thing: Moms are pulled and distracted. I would never say it‚Äôs worse for me because I‚Äôm an actor.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That frankness ‚Äî about the challenges of being a mother, but also the privileges and the desire and how to make it work with her life ‚Äî is what not only distinguishes Britton‚Äôs image, but makes it meaningful to so many women.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212647\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/enhanced/webdr12/anigif_enhanced-mid-30924-1415515869-20_preview.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Cult of Connie Britton\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/enhanced/webdr12/anigif_enhanced-mid-30924-1415515869-20.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Britton isn‚Äôt a movie star ‚Äî and it seems very unlikely she will become one. There‚Äôs a reason her most memorable roles are on television; why the most indelible vision of her isn‚Äôt on the front of a magazine, but in the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> opening credits, with her hair pulled haphazardly up, in a cotton T-shirt, raising her hands in the air in a dance-like victory. She could be your own mom, or sister, or best friend, proclaiming some small life victory in your own little kitchen after a glass of wine at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>With a liberal arts education and a thoroughly middle-class upbringing, Britton‚Äôs image resonates most with women whose trajectories are similar: On and off <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, she may be advocating for those who don‚Äôt enjoy the same privilege as she does, but the cult of Britton does skew toward those who are educated, middle class, and white. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that this is Britton‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù ‚Äî her race, class, and educational background were in place long before she became a star ‚Äî so much as to underline that Britton resonates with a particular demographic that, uncoincidentally, makes up a significant percentage of people who are sharing things on social media.</p>\n<p>This sort of highly specific popularity is the new normal: Instead of a common group of Hollywood stars and prominent public figures who function as de facto models for everyone, the fragmentation of the American entertainment industry has birthed more, not fewer, idols. The internet has facilitated the elevation of the weird, the unique, and those who speak specifically to groups of people who feel that no other mainstream idol could.</p>\n<p>Stardom scholar Richard Dyer <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Heavenly_Bodies.html?id=oUJ0Qbse7lYC\">claimed</a> that ‚Äústars matter because they act out aspects of life that matter to us; and performers get to be stars when what they act out matters to enough people.‚Äù Connie Britton can‚Äôt be a star, then, because what she acts out ‚Äî the possibility of beauty and vibrancy and sexuality over 40, unabashed advocacy and engaged feminist action ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt yet matter to enough people.</p>\n<p>The adult cult of Connie Britton is vocal and visible, but it‚Äôs still a fringe fandom. But the history of stardom is littered with actors whose importance didn‚Äôt become clear until years after their tenure, especially unruly, feminist ones like Katharine Hepburn, who was famously labeled ‚Äúbox office poison‚Äù in 1939, only to the next four decades slowly turning herself into an icon. But along with stars like Angelina Jolie, who has made it her mission <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/angelina-jolies-perfect-game\">to offer a different blueprint</a> for how to wield power and influence in Hollywood, Britton is fundamentally challenging the polished, safe, postfeminist vision of female stardom that currently dominates so much of the Hollywood landscape. And that‚Äôs something like progress, y‚Äôall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4207834\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

There is an infinite¬†difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and Robespierre who eternally¬†returns, chopping off French heads.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"item-share-tools article-footer\">\n<div class=\"short-url\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/297219\"></div>\n<div class=\"share-buttons colored\"><ul data-author=\"Kabir Chibber\" data-title=\"The new ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äù game is reviving an ancient debate over the French Revolution\" data-on=\"none\">\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;url=http://qz.com/297219&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://qz.com/297219\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"linkedin\"><a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://qz.com/297219&amp;title=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;summary=The%20latest%C2%A0%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed:%20Unity%E2%80%9D%20video%20game%20allows%20you,%20the%20player,%20to%20roam%20freely%20around%20an%20ancient%20city%20as%20part%20of%20its%C2%A0usual,%20incomprehensible%20plot%20about%20assassins,%20conspiracy,%20and%20revenge.%20But%20this%20time,%20the%20game%20is%20set%20in%20Paris%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution,%20and%20the%20game%20is%20ruffling%20a%20few%20feathers%20in%20France%20for%20its%20depiction%20of%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"email\"><a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;body=http://qz.com/297219%0A%0AThe%20latest%C2%A0%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed:%20Unity%E2%80%9D%20video%20game%20allows%20you,%20the%20player,%20to%20roam%20freely%20around%20an%20ancient%20city%20as%20part%20of%20its%C2%A0usual,%20incomprehensible%20plot%20about%20assassins,%20conspiracy,%20and%20revenge.%20But%20this%20time,%20the%20game%20is%20set%20in%20Paris%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution,%20and%20the%20game%20is%20ruffling%20a%20few%20feathers%20in%20France%20for%20its%20depiction%20of%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"whatsapp\"><a title=\"Share on WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=The%20new%20%E2%80%9CAssassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed%E2%80%9D%20game%20is%20reviving%20an%20ancient%20debate%20over%20the%20French%20Revolution:%20http://qz.com/297219\"></a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"related-headlines-297219\" class=\"empty\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 11:51:58.079021"], ["link_identifier", "http://qz.com/297219"], ["main_img_url", "http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap443026659085.jpg?w=1600, http://img.qz.com/2014/11/ap443026659085.jpg?w=2400 2x"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-16"], ["title", "The new ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äù game is reviving an ancient debate over the French Revolution"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 11:51:58.079021"]]

Gates and Buffett gave the same one-word answer: ‚ÄúFocus.‚Äù (See more in¬†<em>The Snowball</em>¬†by Alice Schroeder).</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84367\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">I love the clarity of their answer but I am also concerned by how this can be, to quote Rudyard Kipling, ‚Äútwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.‚Äù I am an advocate for focus in work, life and leadership. However, the subject has a nuance and depth that many people miss. For a start, most people think of there only being one kind of focus.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a noun</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84368\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">When people speak of focus they usually mean having a single goal. It is a static thing, a thing you¬†<em>have</em>. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Roger Bannister relentlessly pursuing his goal of breaking the four-minute mile, John F. Kennedy challenging NASA to put a man on the moon within a decade or, coming back to Bill Gates, a vision of a personal computer on every desk. The upside to this kind of focus is clear and compelling: you pursue a single objective and don‚Äôt get distracted along the way; you build momentum as many different people aligned behind achieving this one goal.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84369\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">However, there is a dark side to focus as a noun. It‚Äôs what we might think of as the Kodak Problem. Kodak was relentlessly focused on a single objective‚Äîand it almost killed them. They found themselves caught off guard by the disruptive innovation of digital cameras. Kodak was so focused on optimizing for traditional film capture and processing that they did not see or accept the transformation in their industry. This is where the second type of focus comes in.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a verb</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84370\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focus is not just something you¬†<em>have</em>¬†it is also something you¬†<em>do</em>. This type of focus is not static; it is an intense, dynamic, ongoing, iterative process. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Steve Jobs saying to Jony Ive day after day, ‚ÄúThis might be crazy, but what if we‚Ä¶‚Äù until once in a while the idea took the air out of the room. It‚Äôs the constant exploration needed to see what is really going on and what the ‚Äúnoun focus‚Äù should be.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84371\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Imagine if the moment you woke up this morning your eyes focused one time and then never adjusted again. You would be out of focus all day. Our eyes produce clarity through a perpetual process of adjustment. Similarly, in our lives and on our teams, it is not enough to say, ‚ÄúWe have our focus!‚Äù Rather, and adapting Dwight D. Eisenhower statement, ‚ÄúFocus is nothing, focusing is everything.‚Äù That may take the point too far, but it still makes the point that having a focus is insufficient.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84372\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The downside to thinking of focus as a verb¬†only, is that it can lead to being overly reactive. It can lead people to making and remaking decisions too fast for any real momentum to take place. It can result in counterfeit agility where things feel fast but people aren‚Äôt going forward. It can become motion sickness instead of momentum.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84373\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The answer is to develop and value both types of focus. Professor Henry Mintzberg taught that there are two sources of strategy:</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Deliberate¬†strategy</strong>, where leaders develop a clear vision and map this to long, medium and short term goals (focus as a noun);</li>\n<li>\n<strong>emergent¬†strategy</strong>, where people respond to unanticipated problems and opportunities (focus as a verb).</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84374\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">It is the disciplined pursuit of both of these approaches that best enables us to focus on what is essential. We can plot this on a two by two to see what is at stake.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-231910\" src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/07/2.jpg?w=900&amp;h=551\" alt=\"2\" width=\"900\" height=\"551\"></p>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84375\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Here are three ways to combine both types of focus to ensure we getting the vital few things done.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84376\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Bill Gates said of Warren Buffett,<em>¬†‚Äú</em>I first met him‚Ä¶ at a dinner my mother had put together. On my way there, I thought, ‚ÄòWhy would I want to meet this guy who picks stocks?‚Äô I thought he just used various market-related things‚Äîlike volume, or how the price had changed over time‚Äîto make his decisions. But when we started talking that day, he didn‚Äôt ask me about any of those things. Instead he started asking big questions about the fundamentals of our business. ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt IBM do what Microsoft does? Why has Microsoft been so profitable?‚Äô That‚Äôs when I realized he thought about business in a much more profound way than I‚Äôd given him credit for.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"84377\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">In order to¬†have¬†focus we need to escape¬†to¬†focus. As I wrote in¬†<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400517057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=essentialism+the+disciplined+pursuit+of+less\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essentialism</a>, ‚Äú</em>I once attended a question-and-answer session with Bill at the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. By chance he had just completed his latest ‚ÄòThink Week.‚Äô Though I had heard about this practice, what I didn‚Äôt know was that it goes all the way back to the 1980s and that he stuck to it through the height of Micro- soft‚Äôs expansion. In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic time in the company‚Äôs history, he still created time and space to seclude himself for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112) and books, study technology, and think about the bigger picture. Today he still takes the time away from the daily distractions of running his foundation to simply think. Whether you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\n<h2>Know how valuable your time is</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84378\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">As Bill Gates has written,¬†‚ÄúNo matter how much money you have, you can‚Äôt buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone‚Äôs day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn‚Äôt let his calendar get filled up with useless meetings. On the other hand, he‚Äôs very generous with his time for the people he trusts. He gives his close advisers at Berkshire his phone number, and they can just call him up and he‚Äôll answer the phone.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84379\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focusing on what is essential is a powerful ability, perhaps the most powerful in a world where we are so bombarded with distracting ideas, information and opinions. However, if we want to consistently give our energies to what is essential we need to develop¬†both¬†kinds of focus. Only in this way can we answer with confidence the question, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important now?‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84380\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>This post originally appeared at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140707144749-8353952-the-one-word-answer-to-why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-have-been-so-successful?trk=mp-reader-card\">LinkedIn</a>.

As with many religions, complete unthinking devotion is required from its practitioners. Nothing in life is allowed to be more important than our children, and we must never speak a disloyal word about our relationships with our offspring. Children always come first.

Following the publication of her essay, Waldman was not only shouted down by America for being a bad mother; strangers threatened her physically and told her that they would report her to child protective services. This is not how a civil society conducts open-minded discourse. This is how a religion persecutes a heretic.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\" style=\"display: none;\"><iframe id=\"537516121_de2\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111220\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">The origins of the parenthood religion are obscure, but one of its first manifestations may have been the ‚Äúbaby on board‚Äù placards that became <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703916004576271282489578512\" target=\"_blank\">popular in the mid-1980s</a>. Nobody would have placed such a sign on a car if it were not already understood by society that the life of a human achieves its peak value at birth and declines thereafter. A toddler is almost as precious as a baby, but a teenager less so, and by the time that baby turns fifty, it seems that nobody cares much anymore if someone crashes into her car. You don‚Äôt see a lot of vehicles with placards that read, ‚ÄúMiddle-aged accountant on board.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\n<h2>Read: <a href=\"http://qz.com/275987/you-probably-dont-know-the-real-story-behind-baby-on-board-signs/\" target=\"_blank\">You probably don‚Äôt know the real story behind Baby on Board signs</a>\n</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111221\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Another sign of the parenthood religion is that it has become totally unacceptable in our culture to say anything bad about our children, let alone admit that we don‚Äôt like them all of the time. We are allowed to say bad things about our spouses, our parents, our aunts and uncles, but try saying, ‚ÄúMy kid doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends because she‚Äôs not a super likable person,‚Äù and see how fast you get dropped from the PTA.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"111222\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">When people choose to have children, they play a lottery. Children have the same range of positive and negative characteristics as adults, and the personalities of some children are poorly matched with those of their parents. Nature has protected children against such a circumstance by endowing them with irresistible cuteness early on, and by ensuring that parents bond with children sufficiently strongly that our cave-dwelling ancestors didn‚Äôt push their offspring out in a snowbank when they misbehaved. Much as parents love their children and have their best interests at heart, however, they don‚Äôt always like them. That guy at the office who everyone thinks is a jerk was a kid once upon a time, and there‚Äôs a pretty good chance that his parents also noticed that he could be a jerk. They just weren‚Äôt allowed to say so.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"3\" data-thread-id=\"111223\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Of course, Ayelet Waldman‚Äôs blasphemy was not admitting that her kids were less than completely wonderful, only that she loved her husband more than them. This falls into the category of thou-shalt-have-no-other-gods-before-me. As with many religious crimes, judgment is not applied evenly across the sexes. Mothers must devote themselves to their children above anyone or anything else, but many wives would be offended if their husbands said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty great, but my love for you will never hold a candle to the love I have for John Junior.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111224\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Mothers are also holy in a way that fathers are not expected to be. Mothers live in a clean, cheerful world filled with primary colors and children‚Äôs songs, and they don‚Äôt think about sex. A father could admit to desiring his wife without seeming like a distracted parent, but society is not as willing to cut Ms. Waldman that same slack. It is unseemly for a mother to enjoy pleasures that don‚Äôt involve her children.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111225\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">There are doubtless benefits that come from elevating parenthood to the status of a religion, but there are obvious pitfalls as well. Parents who do not feel free to express their feelings honestly are less likely to resolve problems at home. Children who are raised to believe that they are the center of the universe have a tough time when their special status erodes as they approach adulthood. Most troubling of all, couples who live entirely child-centric lives can lose touch with one another to the point where they have nothing left to say to one another when the kids leave home.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"4\" data-thread-id=\"111226\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In the 21st century, most Americans marry for love. We choose partners who we hope will be our soulmates for life. When children come along, we believe that we can press pause on the soulmate narrative, because parenthood has become our new priority and religion. We raise our children as best we can, and we know that we have succeeded if they leave us, going out into the world to find partners and have children of their own. Once our gods have left us, we try to pick up the pieces of our long neglected marriages and find new purpose. Is it surprising that divorce rates are rising fastest for <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/fashion/weddings/divorce-after-50-grows-more-common.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">new empty nesters</a>?¬†Perhaps it is time that we gave the parenthood religion a second thought.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111227\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>We welcome your comments at <a href=\"mailto:ideas@qz.com\" target=\"_blank\">ideas@qz.com</a>.

And that is down to higher pupil aspiration, ambition, and engagement among migrants.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126391\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">There is nothing inherently different in the educational performance of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds, but the children of relatively recent immigrants typically have greater hopes and expectations of education, and are, on average, more likely to be engaged with their school work. This is not by chance of course; a key part of the ‚ÄúLondon effect‚Äù is that city‚Äôs attraction to migrants and those aspiring to a better life.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\"><iframe id=\"537516121_gyd2\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126392\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">The best way to measure how a school, or a city-wide school system, fares is to look at pupil progress. This is what I do here, focusing on progress through secondary school. Progress is defined by comparing the GCSE points score to Key Stage 2 scores.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126393\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">What do we see? First, there is a London premium in pupil progress of just over eight GCSE grade points, where a grade point is the difference between A and B, or D and E. (For an international comparison this is 9.8% of a standard deviation). This is a huge number: the difference between say getting eight Cs rather than eight Ds.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126394\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">Ethnic composition matters a great deal. In fact, differences in composition account for all of the gap in the progress measure. If I assume that London had the same ethnic composition as the rest of England, then given the progress of each ethnic group in each place (London/not London), there would be no ‚ÄúLondon effect.‚Äù An easy way to see this is through a simple regression. Apply the ‚ÄúLondon effect‚Äù to all the pupils in all state schools in England, first not taking account of ethnicity and then adding those controls in, and this graph shows the effect is wiped out.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126395\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">There are two important cases where accounting for ethnicity halves the London premium but does not entirely eliminate it. If we consider GCSE points excluding¬†<a href=\"http://archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/page.aspx?o=131318\">the various vocational qualifications</a>, such as the GCSE in Applied Health and Social Care or the GCSE in Leisure and Tourism, there remains a small but significant London effect. This in turn arises because pupils in London enter for significantly fewer of these courses. The implications of this are unclear.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126396\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">It is certainly not appropriate to simply remove some subject scores from the total and claim that the remainder represents ‚Äútrue‚Äù progress. Nevertheless, the fact that London schools systematically entered pupils for less of these qualifications may represent the outcome of a particular policy.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126397\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">A measure of very high exam performance also yields a small but significant London effect. This may derive from the very high concentration of professional families in London and their high input into their children‚Äôs education (which is not captured by a socio-economic variable that just measures eligibility for free school meals).</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126398\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">Many school leaders, politicians and commentators enthuse about the success of a major policy of the time,¬†<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\">London Challenge</a>, and view it as¬†<a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/resources/london-challenge\">unambiguously improving schools in London</a>. This unanimity carries weight‚Äîand no doubt London schools have improved in a number of ways. But so far at least, catching a reflection of this improvement in the data is proving to be difficult.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126399\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">It sounds somehow uninspiring and disappointing that the London attainment premium is largely ‚Äúaccounted for by demographic composition‚Äù rather than wholly caused by a clever policy. I disagree. It can be seen as a story of aspiration and ambition. There is nothing inherently different about the ability of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds, but the children of immigrants typically have high aspirations and ambitions, and might place greater hopes in the education system.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<figure class=\"align-center\"></figure><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126400\" data-article-id=\"297215\" class=\"annotatable\">There is a clear desire among commentators to hang on to the ‚ÄúLondon effect.‚Äù As noted above, this can be done by focusing on a subset of GCSE exams‚Äîvocational qualifications‚Äîand taking that as the outcome measure.

He frequently springs up to further demonstrate whatever point he‚Äôs in the middle of making, and even when he is seated, his deep, throaty voice races headlong out of him, his mouth often tripping over his words.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had spaghetti bolognese for lunch, which felt amazing at the time, and then I hit a wall,‚Äù he tells BuzzFeed News at the outset of his interview last month. ‚ÄúI have a vat of coffee here, which is propelling me back into form. So hopefully my chat will not stink.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Redmayne‚Äôs infectious verve is, ironically, in service of explaining how he learned to keep his body resolutely stiff and static. With the new film <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, the 32-year-old Redmayne has been winning the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonwillmore/benedict-cumberbatch-vs-eddie-redmayne\">best reviews</a> of his young career, as well as considerable Oscar buzz, for his performance as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who has famously spent the vast majority of his career in a wheelchair due to a physically debilitating motor neuron disease similar to ALS.

Its main emotional focus, however, is how the disease affected his romance with and eventual marriage to Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whose memoir served as the basis for the film. Playing Hawking proposed one of the most intimidating challenges imaginable for an actor: Faithfully portraying the physical specificity of Hawking‚Äôs disease meant bottling up virtually every tool available to capture his emotional inner life.</p>\n<p>But according to <i>The Theory of Everything</i>‚Äôs director, James Marsh (<i>Man on Wire</i>), it was a challenge that Redmayne was up to from the moment the two first met to discuss the role. ‚ÄúEddie‚Äôs a very intelligent actor,‚Äù Marsh says a few weeks later on the phone. ‚ÄúI was struck by how much he understood the nature of the psychology of the role, and what he had to do is to physically prepare for what then would become an emotional performance. The physicality needed to be in place and embedded, essentially, into his preparation. Once that was in place, then the real work began to bring this character to life emotionally.

But with dancers, they‚Äôre extraordinary artists, and it‚Äôs like‚Äù ‚Äî he began clapping his hands ‚Äî ‚Äú<i>do it again, do it again, do it again</i> until you get it right. That was the rigor in which I wanted to work ‚Äî not to compromise. ‚Ä¶ For Stephen, the disease couldn‚Äôt be less important. Like, he has <i>no</i> interest in it,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúI wanted to make sure that this is not a story of a disease. It‚Äôs an unconventional love story.

But those losses are specific to each person, which meant Redmayne had to sort out ‚Äî based mostly on archival photos and whatever he could find on YouTube ‚Äî how Hawking‚Äôs motor neuron disease uniquely manifested itself, and when. He then showed those images to the doctors at Queen Square so they could render a loose sort of diagnosis.</p>\n<p>After filling an iPad with every scrap of visual and documentary material he collected, Redmayne then created a single, double-sided master list, which charted out the details he‚Äôd need to know for every single scene.

But the only documentary footage there is of him speaking, he is completely incomprehensible. His students would have to come and spend two weeks learning to lip-read him and understand him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Redmayne pressed Marsh and screenwriter Anthony McCarten to include Hawking‚Äôs completely slurred speech in the film ‚Äî but the film‚Äôs producers balked at having one of their lead actors be totally unintelligible to the audience.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt subtitle it,‚Äù says Marsh. ‚ÄúThat felt somehow wrong. So Eddie very graciously took a step back from the truth of what he found out, and we found a kind compromise for the film. I don‚Äôt think he ever was very comfortable with it, nor was I. But I could see why the producers were wanting something that was just a bit more comprehensible.

For that, he relied especially on Marsh and Jones. <i>The Theory of Everything</i> spends just as much time exploring Jane Hawking‚Äôs life as it does Stephen‚Äôs, and how all-consuming it became for her to care for her husband. ‚ÄúI remember being in a rehearsal room with Eddie, and Eddie‚Äôs in the chair, and then suddenly you feel as the person playing the carer you have this enormous responsibility,‚Äù Jones says. ‚ÄúAt a certain point, Stephen couldn‚Äôt just lift up a spoon. So Jane‚Äôs got to be there doing it for him. So suddenly, I was like, <i>Gosh, I‚Äôve got to be the responsible one in this situation!</i> She was Stephen‚Äôs movement in the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Indeed, the circumstances of their characters put a great deal of literal and figurative weight on Jones‚Äô shoulders. ‚ÄúNormally, when you arrive on a film set each morning, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to shoot the scene here,‚Äô‚Äù says Redmayne. ‚ÄúJames will have an opinion. Then maybe Felicity will say, ‚ÄòActually, maybe I‚Äôll try it in this seat.‚Äô You‚Äôre playing with ideas. But virtually every single day on this, I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt move from here.‚Äô She has to do all the heavy lifting ‚Äî a lot of it, as far as keeping the energy in scenes. It was really complicated. She was a sensational friend throughout it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Before filming, Jones and Redmayne knew each other from their earlier work during Michael Grandage‚Äôs tenure overseeing the Donmar Warehouse Theatre in London, but they only really became ‚Äúgreat friends,‚Äù as Redmayne puts it, while making the film. That friendship was sealed very early in the production during a scene in which, after learning of his diagnosis, Jane pushes a deeply depressed Stephen to play croquet with her ‚Äî only to be quietly devastated when she sees just how physically debilitated he‚Äôd already become. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs setting up a challenge, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù says Jones. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt going to be easy.‚Äô It‚Äôs totally a test. And he‚Äôs saying if you can get through this, then maybe we can spend our lives together.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255860\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"425\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 377px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255860','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jones and Redmayne in the croquet scene in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It became a kind of test for Jones and Redmayne, as well, after Redmayne asked Jones to tease him off camera when it was time for him to shoot Stephen struggling to play croquet. ‚ÄúThat takes great trust, because she basically sort of started in,‚Äù he says, laughing. ‚ÄúAnd she knew where to hit me.

And I‚Äôm running with them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264360\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2698-1416067351-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2698-1416067351-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"139\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 91px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264360','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/11/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2698-1416067351-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I first saw the desert in books. Big, blank, and imaginary; it was perfect. A boy‚Äôs world of dominoed dunes and empty spaces that stretched and shimmered across the pages my mother read to me every evening in our Nebraska apartment.</p>\n<p>My father had just left, and I was having trouble sleeping. My baby brother didn‚Äôt seem bothered. But I was a couple years older and more easily frightened. During the day I rarely spoke or cried, but at night I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. My mom must have been struggling too, because at some point during that ugly stretch reading became our thing. There had always been bedtime stories, but this was something different. This was a mother‚Äôs magic trick, the borrowing of alternate worlds to escape our own.</p>\n<p>We started with Bible stories, bearded patriarchs and long robes, before working our way through the public library‚Äôs collection of <i>The Black Stallion</i> books. I adored Alec, the redheaded hero of the series, almost as much as I loved the Black, the wild Arabian stallion at its center. The pair appealed to me because they were me, or at least the me I wanted to be. Alec was young and independent, free from parental interference, and the Black was big and loyal, just like my own horse.</p>\n<p>After the divorce, my mother had fixated on the animal, stubbornly refusing to sell our one luxury. Molly wasn‚Äôt black or a stallion, but my mind was already learning to skip past the awkward inconsistencies of life. I didn‚Äôt know Palomino or mare. But I knew horse. And that‚Äôs what I had. Sitting on Molly wearing a plastic cowboy hat, I spent my days playing through the stories we read at night. One minute I was Alec racing the Black through Arabia, the next I was Jedediah Smith crossing the Mojave. Already I was learning the dangers of the desert. Smith, my mother would read one night, died on the Santa Fe Trail full of Comanche arrows. Another night, Alec got trampled. Slowly, as the stories began to accumulate, tragedy seeped into play. ‚ÄúSorry, Molly,‚Äù I would whisper toward the end of our sessions, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre lost and I have to eat you.‚Äù Patting her neck, I tried to ease the sting of my words. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll survive.‚Äù</p>\n<p>As our reading times expanded, so too did my imagination. What started as a desperate attempt to get a scared little boy to sleep had grown into a ritualized treat: reading time with mom. The comfort of her voice gave way to the rhythm of the story, as I went from not knowing the shapes of letters to sounding out words. Only later, when I started to go off on my own, reading large chunks while she was away at work, did things change. For a while we had two sets of books: ours and mine. But that didn‚Äôt last either. I read too much, too fast. And as my stack of library books dwindled, I tended to steal from our shared pile. My tastes changed as well, moving out from the half-shelves around the library checkout counter to Hardy Boys mysteries and western biographies deeper in the stacks. But I never left the desert, not really.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264317\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1100\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1417px; top: 1052px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264317','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>First it was Cairo, on a semester abroad program during my junior year. Then it was the Peace Corps in Jordan after graduation. That was the beginning, a decade in which I spent much of my time living in the Middle East. It was also the decade of 9/11 and a pair of massive wars.</p>\n<p>Cairo was exotic but crowded and Jordan‚Äôs eastern desert was drab and dreary, more volcanic rock than sand. But Yemen was different. Vibrant and stark, it felt like the underside of a rainbow. Sanaa had character and a wild, intoxicating charm. Politics, even at the top, was real and contested. Ali Abdullah Salih, a rough-talking president with a whiskey habit, had been in charge since before I was born, but even he was constrained. Tribes mattered more than parties, and alliances were always in flux. For a year, I spent my mornings reading Arab histories and my afternoons parsing rumors in sweaty little rooms where the smoke floated in layers. I was 24 years old and I was hooked.</p>\n<p>A trio of guards and doormen were my guides that first year. They taught me how to chew qat, rubbing and polishing the leaves, and welcomed me into their circle. We went shooting together in the desert, and opened up to each other in the awkward, fumbling manner of boys learning to become men.</p>\n<p>One day, Shaqib confessed this was how he imagined heaven: the four of us sitting around chewing qat, laughing and joking. ‚ÄúParadise,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúis the best of this world.‚Äù And that year the best of our world took place in a cramped little guard shack with crumbling walls off al-Bawniya Street. Outside everything was a mess with horrifying pictures from Abu Ghraib and Saddam in a spider hole. But inside there was the gentle grace of centuries and the human warmth and dignity that in Yemen could transcend everything else. Politics was one thing; personal interactions were something else.</p>\n<p>Most evenings, after qat, I slipped off on my own for a quiet walk. I usually turned right toward Zubayri Street and my favorite bookshop, dusty and disorderly, before reversing course for Sanaa‚Äôs old city and a glass of milky tea. History lived near the surface on those walks. I passed a bombed-out palace from Yemen‚Äôs last revolution in 1962 and, a bit further on, a paved-over square where the imam used to behead dissidents with a single stroke from a sword called ‚ÄúThe Purifier.‚Äù The palace had been converted into a secret prison, and teenagers played soccer all night in the square. But the past was still there if you knew where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264376\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264376\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264376\"}}' rel:description=\"For the first time I felt physically unsafe.

In late 2012, after the Arab Spring and the uprisings that forced Salih to step down, I scheduled another quick trip. I had lived through the revolution in Cairo, and had seen the expectations of change and a better life inflate and then burst leaving everyone more confused than ever. Yemen had changed as well. No one seemed to know the rules anymore. Salih was out and security was evaporating. There was a mad scramble for power that fall, and for the first time I felt physically unsafe. It was just a feeling, impossible to quantify, but I couldn‚Äôt shake it.</p>\n<p>Yemeni friends on Twitter and Facebook disagreed with my assessment, claiming I had lost my feel for the country. And maybe I had. What did I know about predicting violence? But I wasn‚Äôt alone. Among the small group of Yemen watchers, the numbers had started to lose their meaning with repetition: 40% chance of bombing, 60% chance of being kidnapped. They were guesses without an anchor. No one knew anything for certain. Western embassies issued travel warnings, but they were as vague as everything else. Yemen was bad ‚Äî maybe not Iraq bad ‚Äî but the speculation kept getting worse.</p>\n<p>Still, earlier this spring I decided to go back one more time. I pitched it to my editors as a three-story trip. But in my mind, it was a final farewell. I was getting married in a few months, and I wanted to move on and write about other things. I‚Äôd quit smoking years earlier and my twenties had slipped into my thirties. I was ready for a change. On March 6, I boarded the plane for my last trip to Yemen.</p>\n<p>Sixteen days later I was done. I had my three stories, or at least the notes and interviews to write them. But I didn‚Äôt want to leave, not yet. Something was still missing. Instead of flying home early, I compromised: One more story.</p>\n<p>I already knew the one I‚Äôd do. The ghost story every writer has, the one they obsess over and worry about; always researching, never writing. Mine was a tragedy that started with a Guantanamo interrogation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Detainee: I am from Urday City in Yemen, not a city in al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ My city is very far from the city of al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ That is not my name and I am not from that city‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: al-Qaeda is not a city. It is the name of an organization.</p>\n<p>Detainee: Whether it is a city or an organization, I am not from al-Qaeda. I am from Urday City.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Are you from Yemen?</p>\n<p>Detainee: Yes, I am from Urday.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you travel from Yemen to Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I went from Yemen to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you do that in the year 2000?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I don‚Äôt know the time.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Was it the year 1421?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I am from a village, I cannot tell time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The detainee, Adnan Abd al-Latif, was a mentally unstable man who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a car crash in 1994. Twice he had been cleared for release, but each time something went wrong and he remained locked in his cell, counting the days until there was nothing left to count. On Sept. 10, 2012, he committed suicide. He had been in Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs case seemed to get at all the horrors of that lost decade: a handicapped man who confused al-Qaeda with a Yemeni village of the same name, locked up as the worst of the worst. For 10 years, while Latif befriended the iguanas and banana rats that wandered into his cell, the U.S. and Yemen fought for custody. Neither side would give in. The U.S. had him but wouldn‚Äôt let him go; Yemen wanted him but couldn‚Äôt get him.</p>\n<p>Then Latif killed himself with a fistful of pills and positions changed. Now neither country wanted him. The U.S. needed him gone, but Yemen wouldn‚Äôt take him. In death, just as in life, he was in legal limbo ‚Äî neither here nor there. Instead of Guantanamo, Latif was sent to Germany, where his body was frozen and stored at Ramstein Air Base while the two countries argued over who had to take the corpse.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs story was sad, but mostly it was just human. He wasn‚Äôt nameless or faceless, an abstract stand-in for our fears. He was a man with a history and a family, and I wanted to write about them, to tell his story. In my mind it was less about Guantanamo Bay than it was about the withering of hope and how a single man had been ground down to nothing by a pair of bureaucracies. But no one else seemed to see it this way. Obama had already ordered the prison closed. He just hadn‚Äôt succeeded. Guantanamo was still open, and indefinite detention was still the law of the land. But the country had moved on; a collective forgetting that let us pretend everything had changed when nothing had.</p>\n<p>Before I left the U.S. I had reached out to one of the Guantanamo lawyers and he gave me the name of Latif‚Äôs brother in Yemen. Muhammad lived in Taizz, four hours south of Sanaa. But Yemen was still coming apart, and the roads were too dangerous for a drive. I asked Muhammed if he would fly to Sanaa for an interview.</p>\n<p>Since arriving in Sanaa I had been working with Shuaib, a young fixer and friend, who knew how to get things done in a country where nothing worked. That morning I met him at the ticket office to buy Muhammad‚Äôs plane ticket. The money I had just collected from Western Union went from me to Shuaib to the man behind the counter. I signed the receipt, the man behind the counter stamped it, and Shuaib called Taizz to confirm that Muhammad was on his way to the airport. It was just after 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 22. Muhammad‚Äôs flight landed in three hours, and Shuaib wanted breakfast.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the ticket office, Zubayri Street had been quiet. In another hour the shadows would be gone and the street would be noisy and hot with four jumbled lanes of traffic. But for the moment it was neither. Caught between the two, Zubayri Street came to life in fits and starts. Shuaib moved through it quickly, claiming he could smell something good. I smelled diesel and cigarettes. After a block whatever scent he was tracking had disappeared, and he gave up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go in here,‚Äù he said. The restaurant looked like every other one on the street: an open front with a roll-up shutter, a counter in the front, kitchen in the back, and long metal tables in between. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. But I didn‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôd already had breakfast; I just wanted another cup of coffee. ‚ÄúThis is fine.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Stepping up onto the sidewalk, Shuaib bumped into a soldier who was coming out of the restaurant, catching his windbreaker on the man‚Äôs rifle. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he mumbled, as he reached over to untangle his jacket. The man just looked at him, taking in Shuaib‚Äôs youth and his slight frame. And then he saw me. I was used to it, the attention and the double takes. Yemenis tend to stare at obvious foreigners, observing them as if they were under glass. But this time the lack of words was disconcerting. We were in the man‚Äôs space, inches from his face with Shuaib‚Äôs jacket hooked on his rifle. The whole thing was too intimate for silence. But the man in the olive green uniform didn‚Äôt say a word. Only his eyes moved, following Shuaib‚Äôs fingers as they slid up the barrel of his gun. Then we were free and moving again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_right_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264382\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:description=\"It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3513705_4264382\" rel:via=\"gregorydjohnsen\" rel:sub_title=\"It%20was%20nothing%20and%20he%20was%20no%20one,%20a%20soldier%20with%20a%\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:14\" rel:count=\"4\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitter'; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #004F9E; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That was it, a few seconds on the street before breakfast.

Both of them were young, and both had guns.</p>\n<p>The first man, the one Shuaib had bumped into, crossed the space between us surprisingly quickly and grabbed his arm. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù he asked in rough Arabic, with a gesture toward me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my friend,‚Äù Shuaib replied.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIs he a foreigner?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Shuaib said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an American researcher.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the man said, pulling Shuaib toward the street. ‚ÄúCome to the base with us.

Grabbing my arm, he started pulling me toward the street. My eyes followed my body and I saw the yellow-and-white taxi: driver inside, back door open.

He resisted, breaking free of his Yemeni kidnappers in a Sanaa supermarket. He lasted only a few terrifying seconds. The kidnappers caught back up to him and, in the middle of a grocery store aisle, they executed him.</p>\n<p>Back in the U.S., talking through my options with Asha, the woman I would marry, I had been uncertain. I told her what to do ‚Äî who to call and what to say if I were taken. But I hadn‚Äôt been able to decide on my own course of action: submit or resist. Each had benefits, each had drawbacks; neither was good. Yet when the moment came, my body didn‚Äôt give me a choice.

In my heart or out loud, in Arabic or English, I don‚Äôt know. But I said it: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting into that cab.‚Äù Then I jerked my arm back. The man pulled harder, and we were scuffling. There was no punching or screaming, none of the things I would have imagined, just a weird one-armed tug-of-war over a few yards of asphalt. I was older and stronger, but he had a gun. His hand, dry and cracked, slipped down past my wrist, catching on the backpack that I had slung over one arm. For a second, I thought about dropping the backpack and running. But it had the rest of the $600 I‚Äôd pulled out of Western Union, my passport, and all my notebooks from two weeks of work. I tugged.</p>\n<p>Several Yemenis had gathered around us in a loose half-circle. I had always assumed that if something went really wrong, some Yemeni would step up to save me. That had been my insurance policy as I moved through a society that was not my own. But now I was being taken and they were just watching.</p>\n<p>In our world, evil typically wears a mask. It stalks about in disguise, peeking out through the cracks in our humanity. We rarely see it or recognize it when we do, but on that morning in Sanaa it was unmistakable. Dropping Shuaib‚Äôs arm, the man grabbed for his gun. That‚Äôs when I thought he would start shooting. Shuaib moved fast, escaping up the street and scrambling for cover. The second man let go of my backpack to chamber his own bullet, and then I was running too.</p>\n<p>I remembered to zigzag as I ducked into a different restaurant and headed for the back. My plan was to run through the kitchen and escape out the back and then make a big loop back to the American Institute, where I was staying. I made it to the rear of the restaurant, but as I tried to go through the kitchen, one of the Yemeni workers blocked me.</p>\n<p><i>‚ÄúMamnu‚Äòa,‚Äù</i> he said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúForbidden,‚Äù I panted back dumbly. He just stared at me and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> a second time.</p>\n<p>I was trapped. The restaurant was laid out like a giant L, one long main room with a right-angled nook for a sink. I was around the corner by the sink, only a few feet from the door to the kitchen and the way out. But I could no longer see the street and I started to panic. I had to move, to get out of the restaurant. Any second, the men were going to come around the corner. In my mind, I saw the German diplomat lying dead on the grocery store tile.</p>\n<p>I tried to get through the kitchen door a second time, but another employee wrapped me in a giant bear hug and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> yet again. I had no more moves. There was nothing left to react against. Shaking as fear crashed over adrenaline, I tried to think. I needed a plan and I didn‚Äôt have one.</p>\n<p>Fumbling with my backpack, I found my phone and called a contact at the U.S. Embassy. Earlier that week I‚Äôd met him for lunch, seen his guard detail, and ridden in the armored SUV. Maybe he could come to the restaurant and escort me out. But no one picked up. I dialed a second number; still nothing.</p>\n<p>Waiters were still moving back and forth with food and people were eating. But I was stuck, cowering in a corner waiting for whatever came next. A couple of Yemenis came over to tell me that the men were gone, but I didn‚Äôt believe them. Then, someone walked over with a metal cup of water in his hand.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre under my protection.</p>\n<p>I wanted to laugh. He had a cup; the men outside had guns. I explained that they were trying to kidnap me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a foreigner?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúSyrian?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm American.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù he shrugged, and walked away. After that, no one else approached me.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Shuaib came around the corner. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù he said. But my heart was still pounding, and I no longer trusted Yemen or my instincts. I didn‚Äôt move. The corner had become safe.</p>\n<p>Shuaib left and came back. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really gone.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p>\n<p>We grabbed a cab in front of the Chinese Embassy, while Shuaib called the police and I gave the driver directions. ‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt real soldiers,‚Äù Shuaib told me with the phone pressed up against his ear. I held my bag as he told the driver to go the wrong way up a one-way street. Two minutes later we were in front of the American Institute.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStay inside,‚Äù Shuaib implored. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I called the embassy and reported the incident. I told the director and I emailed Asha. Then the electricity went out and there were no more distractions. I imagined Shuaib hit in the head and dumped out of the car. I would be taken to some house for a few days and then smuggled past the checkpoints around Sanaa. After that I‚Äôd be gone. It had happened before, and it would happen again. Sitting alone in my room on a sunny Saturday morning in Sanaa, I felt my fear grow wild and unchained like a beast come back to life. It was the fear of a little boy who didn‚Äôt understand the world or what was happening around him.</p>\n<p>Getting out of the room suddenly seemed very important. I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but it was lunchtime. Time to go. I paused in the courtyard, taking in the walls that kept the rest of Yemen out. They were mud-brick and thick, comforting but debilitating. If I didn‚Äôt go now, I never would. I thought about Molly and my mother‚Äôs voice trying to make me tough for the world to come. ‚ÄúGet back on,‚Äù she‚Äôd say each time I got bucked off. There were no hugs or comfort in those moments, just the cold insistence of a woman who knew how hard life could be. I walked out the door.</p>\n<p>On the surface, the city looked the same, drab beige buildings and the crowded market where I had bought my qat a decade earlier, but it was no longer a place I knew. The bookstore on Zubayri Street was gone, swallowed up by time, and the country was changing as well. The familiar had become foreign. What thrilled me in my twenties frightened me in my thirties. I played with my food until someone asked if I was an American.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264324\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"176\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 128px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264324','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Muhammad wouldn‚Äôt come in when I opened the institute gate for him and Shuaib later that afternoon.

It felt good to unload on him, to scream and rant and finally react to the morning. In that moment, I hated him and his country. He was mad about what happened to his brother, and I was mad about what happened to me.

I was finishing up my first story and I needed an interview. I‚Äôd already talked to his dad and brother on my trip, but it turned out that he had more information than anyone else and that he lived in Brooklyn. I suggested dinner at the Yemen Caf√© on Atlantic.</p>\n<p>I got there early and for a few minutes I just sat and listened to the chatter around me. English and Arabic, familiar and foreign, Brooklyn and Yemen. Everything was so mixed up and messy. The restaurant was different but the same. I couldn‚Äôt separate any of it.</p>\n<p>When I looked up Fahd was coming through the door with two other Yemenis. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned friends, but I didn‚Äôt want to seem like a jerk so I told them to sit down. BuzzFeed would cover the meal. They wanted to hear about my trip and what I thought of Yemen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very bad.‚Äù They just nodded at what they already knew and ordered for me.</p>\n<p>The restaurant was too crowded and noisy for an interview, and one of the men suggested we talk across the street in his shop. The bill had already been paid. But as soon as he pulled down the metal shutters blocking out the light and traffic from Atlantic, I knew it was a mistake. I was in Brooklyn, seven blocks from my apartment, but my body was back in Yemen, locked in a dark room with three Yemeni men. On the audio recording of the interview my voice sounds calm. I make a joke and everyone laughs, but I could feel the truth inside: jittery, full of fear, and looking for a way out.</p>\n<p>For a moment I wondered if I was going mad, then I thought about PTSD. Is that why I was shaking?</p>\n<p>Outside, Brooklyn was chilly and calm, American. I walked Fahd and his friends to the corner and thanked them for dinner. They had been gracious and hospitable, Yemeni. Three distant echoes of the country I once knew.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. For a while I tried to read, but stories had lost their magic. There were no other worlds, only this one. And in it I did the only thing I could. I cried, facedown and helpless, on a pillow where no one could hear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4267370\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Sign up for our BuzzReads email, and you‚Äôll get our best feature stories every Sunday ‚Äî plus other great stories from around the web!</h2>\n\n\n <div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n  \n   \n     <p>\n</p>\n<form rel:gt_cat=\"[ttp]:content\" action=\"http://buzzfeed.createsend.com/t/t/s/jiuhhh/\" method=\"post\">\n<input rel:gt_act=\"input\" id=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-jiuhhh-jiuhhh\" type=\"text\" style=\"font-size:12pt; height:24px; width: 75%\" placeholder=\" your email address\" required=\"\">\n<br><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<input rel:gt_act=\"sign-up\" type=\"submit\" class=\"button2\" value=\"Sign Me Up!\" name=\"submitNewsletter\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"0\">\n</p>\n</form>\n   \n  \n </div>\n\n <p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://embed.contagiousmedia.com/embed/sub/sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq?uri=sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq&amp;cb=1416223871\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this embed ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 12:06:16.293934"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/gregorydjohnsen/how-i-escaped-a-kidnapping-attempt-in-yemen"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/15/12/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14186-1416070878-3.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-16"], ["title", "My Last Day In¬†Yemen"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 12:06:16.293934"]]

The story, she wrote to BuzzFeed News, ‚Äúdumbfounded‚Äù her: It mentioned former students facing mountains of debt for their degrees, but that didn‚Äôt seem to apply to her. Brown believed that she was ‚Äúon a 100% Pell Grant through the government‚Äù and didn‚Äôt owe a cent.</p>\n<p>Everest even paid for her books and her laptop, she wrote, and sent her a stipend check every semester. ‚ÄúWill I have to pay this back or am I one of the few students being treated genuinely by Everest University?‚Äù she asked.</p>\n<p>In reality, most of what Brown believed to be a Pell Grant was actually loans: A review of documents she provided showed she owes more than $26,000.</p>\n<p>Brown, 29, who lives in Kentucky and enrolled at Everest in 2011, has yet to learn that she is going into debt for her degree. (Her last name has been changed because she is a current student.) She no longer has a phone because she is unable to pay the bills, and she sent her student loan documents from a computer at a nearby food bank where she accesses the internet. She has since been hospitalized, unreachable by phone or email.</p>\n<p>Like thousands of other students, Brown has fallen victim to a predatory lender that exploits the aspirations of the poor and disadvantaged. She had good reason to trust Everest Colleges and Universities and its representatives: It is a nationally accredited college, plugged into the government-backed student loan system that pays for the education of millions of students each year. But for thousands of desperate and financially unsophisticated students at Everest, that trust was deeply misplaced.</p>\n<p>Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs publicly traded parent company, is facing a slew of lawsuits and investigations alleging it falsified job records and misrepresented itself to students. The company is effectively being shut down by the federal government; by early next year, it will no longer own any colleges.</p>\n<p>Since July, I have heard from more than 150 current and former students who reached out to me through email, phone, text message, and Facebook after <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/this-new-lawsuit-against-everest-college-explains-why-the-go\">a story about Everest I wrote in April</a> began circulating widely among former students. The vast majority I spoke to were poor women, many of them minorities, who said they were lured to enroll with promises of jobs and good wages that would support their families. They told me they had taken out tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without understanding the extent of their debt, and sometimes not even knowing they were in debt at all. The tactics that admissions officers had used to convince them to enroll, they said, were manipulative and unethical; lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186974\">allege they were illegal</a>.</p>\n<p>By the end of their programs, students owed as much as $50,000, and few believe they will ever be able to repay even a fraction of it. Most said they graduated without jobs, then returned to unemployment or low-paying work in fast-food or retail. They used words like ‚Äúbetrayed,‚Äù ‚Äúlied to,‚Äù and ‚Äúvictimized.‚Äù Many begged for help.</p>\n<p>Corinthian, Everest‚Äôs parent company, has routinely denied most of the allegations in the many lawsuits against the company. Its spokesperson, Kent Jenkins, said that Corinthian has found employment for the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of its tens of thousands of graduates, and that the school regularly provided students with ‚Äúclear and accurate‚Äù information about the cost of their educations and the ability of credits to transfer. He denied that admissions representatives used aggressive or unethical tactics to coerce students into enrolling. Corinthian‚Äôs accreditation and job placement standards, he said, are far more stringent than those at community colleges offering similar programs.</p>\n<p>Corinthian is being sued by the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357655-cfpb-complaint-2014.html\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> and attorneys general in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/\">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html\">Wisconsin</a>, and faces investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and six more states, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corinthian-colleges-20140814-story.html\">criminal probe in California</a>. Earlier this year, the Department of Education reached an <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/the-government-is-finally-forcing-a-major-for-profit-college\">unprecedented agreement</a> to essentially shut down Corinthian, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>But for more than half a million current and former students, neither the shutdown nor the many lawsuits really matter. They will likely see little to no debt relief on their federal loans. They will see none of the jobs they believe they were promised. And while the company may be closing its doors, 85 of Everest‚Äôs campuses aren‚Äôt: They will be sold off, likely to other for-profit college operators or to private equity investors, and will continue to recruit and enroll students.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254424\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"386\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 338px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254424','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The administration office entrance at Everest College in Santa Ana, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>At every step of the way, people fell prey to Everest precisely because of tactics designed to capitalize on their poverty and their trust in an accredited university.

Students spoke of receiving phone calls daily, even four or five times a day. The calls didn‚Äôt end until they agreed to speak at length with an admissions representative, by phone or on campus.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives are salespeople ‚Äî the jobs are advertised as such by Corinthian, according to the California lawsuit. What they sell, though, is something much bigger than a college education, or even the promises of job placement services and $12 hourly salaries. They sell prospective students a future that many of them never imagined was possible.</p>\n<p>Students told me they felt they had no choice but to enroll. Not to do so, they said, seemed like turning down a guarantee at a better life for themselves and their families. ‚ÄúThey put on a great act saying how many jobs were available and how good I was gonna get paid,‚Äù Cacha Cherry, who graduated from Everest in 2010, wrote in an email about the first day she visited an Everest campus. ‚ÄúThey told me about people who had gotten a job and had wonderful careers and great lives ‚Äî how they were able to buy homes, go on vacations, and live this wonderful life.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Cherry had no intention of enrolling that day, but the representatives prepared papers for her to sign, despite her protests. ‚ÄúI felt pressured to sign because I wanted to make a good living for my child ‚Äî I was a young mother trying to make a better life for both of us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>A former admissions representative at Everest, one of five with whom I communicated, said Everest taught a sales tactic her supervisors called ‚Äúpeeling the onion,‚Äù appealing to students‚Äô emotions by asking them leading questions that focused on their hopes and dreams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHow do you think this degree will change your daughter‚Äôs life?‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow meaningful would being the first person in your family to graduate from college be?‚Äô It was all about the emotional side.‚Äù She called the enrollment tactics she was taught ‚Äúbeyond deceptive and immoral, given the circumstances of the prospective students.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives were under heavy pressure to sign up students ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358002-2013-10k-2.html#document/p30/a186771\">until recently, they were paid based</a> in large part on how many students they enrolled, a practice that was made legal under a series of ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù laws passed by the Bush administration in 2002. Those rules were repealed by the Obama administration in 2011, but four former admissions representatives told me that their job performance was evaluated based in part on enrollment numbers.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to hit certain enrollment numbers or risk our jobs,‚Äù said another former admissions representative, who asked not to be named because his current employer is also a for-profit college. ‚ÄúSo plenty of students were enrolled that weren‚Äôt supposed to be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins denied this. Company-wide evaluation standards, the company spokesperson said, ‚Äúdo not include the number of students [admissions representatives] enroll.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Former students said Everest‚Äôs admissions office also used tactics more akin to those found in high-pressure sales environments. Many students who visited Everest‚Äôs campus for tours or simply to pick up brochures said they found themselves ushered into the enrollment and financial aid offices, bombarded by promises about job placement and encouraged to make a choice to better their futures. To get them to enroll immediately, Everest representatives often told students that they risked losing their spot in the school or that the semester was about to begin without them,‚Äù suggesting they may have to wait months or even a year before the next chance to enroll</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was considered a failure if we didn‚Äôt enroll by the end of the day‚Äù of their first visit, said the former admissions representative. Two other former admissions officers made similar assertions. If students seemed hesitant to enroll on their first visit, one representative said, administrators ‚Äúwould meet with them personally‚Äù before they left campus.</p>\n<p>Students said that as a result of the rushed, single-day process, they were given little time to read the documents they were signing. They instead trusted the word of the admissions representative who explained the documents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI remember feeling extremely overwhelmed and confused about what was happening, and by the end of the conversation, I‚Äôd basically signed up for the school and was beginning classes,‚Äù said LaShayna Bell, of Tempe, Arizona, who enrolled in 2010. ‚ÄúIt was like I blinked and missed what I‚Äôd done.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that it is ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù for a student to enroll on the first visit, but would not specify whether that included signing preliminary paperwork. ‚ÄúWe encourage students to take their time and consider it carefully,‚Äù Jenkins said. ‚ÄúWe encourage prospective students to bring a family member or close friend on the first visit, and to ask questions about all aspects of the program.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That family member, however, sometimes turned into another opportunity for the company. Interviews with admissions representatives and former students show that Everest‚Äôs tactics were so aggressive that the school sometimes also enrolled the mothers, sisters, and spouses who accompanied prospective students on campus visits.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254607\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"835\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 787px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254607','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The vast majority of Everest‚Äôs students have no prior experience with college ‚Äî few relatives who attended themselves or high school counselors to help navigate the process. Sintia Lopez, a veteran, emigrated from Nicaragua when she was 12, unable to speak a word of English; she knew nobody who had ever gone to college. She believed her Everest representative when she was told that the school was one of the best in Florida, and believed the representative‚Äôs claim that the high tuition was a sign of quality education that she wouldn‚Äôt get at a community college. She didn‚Äôt know that it was abnormal for a school to call you at all hours of the day, begging you to enroll.</p>\n<p>Admissions representatives enrolled many students who were unlikely, or even unable, to succeed in college: Among those I spoke with, more than a dozen did not have a GED, including an eighth-grade dropout who was enrolled in an accounting program. Several were violent felons who could not legally be employed in the health care industry or criminal justice jobs offered by their programs.</p>\n<p>Many more appeared to be only semi-literate and were unprepared to handle college-level work. One student, who had completed a medical assistant program months after being released from jail on a felony assault charge, wrote to me: ‚ÄúI need getting loans with cleared cause I had just got out of prison and I dont a ged and they promised they would get me a job my name [redacted] please help me.‚Äù She asked not to be named because of her felony.</p>\n<p>At Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee outpost, according to allegations in the Wisconsin attorney general‚Äôs lawsuit, the campus president insisted on turning away students with criminal records who wanted to enroll in health care programs because they could not be employed in the fields they were training for. When the president left, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p9/a186623\">the suit alleges</a>, the school not only ceased using background checks, it called back those students with criminal records who had been turned away and tried to enroll them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255025\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"396\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 348px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255025','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A promotional mailing sent to prospective students, which was included in the complaint by Wisconsin‚Äôs attorney general. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Wisconsin Attorney General / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/complaint-corinthian-colleges-20141027.pdf\">wordpress.com</a></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Everest voluntarily closed the Wisconsin campus two years after its opening, acknowledging it had problems.

Jenkins said the fact that the company had ultimately shut down the Wisconsin campus was evidence that Corinthian was committed to addressing wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt is not in our interest to enroll students who can not successfully complete their courses, and we have policies that are based on that understanding,‚Äù Jenkins said.</p>\n<p>In 2009, according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358001-2009-10kl-2.html#document/p12/a186738\">regulatory filings</a>, 23% of Corinthian students did not have high school diplomas or GEDs.

Everest told her she was very likely to get one paying $14 an hour in her field of study, medical assisting ‚Äî a nine-month certificate degree program for which she would pay $16,400. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs money I can‚Äôt really afford,‚Äù Roberts told me. ‚ÄúBut I feel like this is the only thing I got.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Roberts, her husband, and their three elementary school‚Äìaged children live on the $8-an-hour salary her husband makes as a laborer in a nearby salvage yard, renting a small, sparsely furnished home from her husband‚Äôs boss. (Her name was changed because she is a current student.) Roberts‚Äô son, who is on the autism spectrum, is homeschooled because of his frequent and sometimes violent outbursts, and she is counting on a night job at a hospital so she can stay home with him. Her 11-year-old niece moved in with the family in September.</p>\n<p>If she doesn‚Äôt get a job, Roberts said, ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. We‚Äôre counting on this for a lot of reasons. We‚Äôre completely counting on it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But Roberts is already worried. In her last two months at Everest, she has had seven teachers for a single medical assistant course. She tallies them off on her fingers: Most quit, one saying she‚Äôd never been paid, several moved, others disappeared with no explanation. ‚ÄúWe show up and they‚Äôre gone,‚Äù she said. Instead of normal good-byes at the end of class, she said, students say to teachers, ‚ÄúHope we see you tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations in the many lawsuits against Corinthian Colleges paint a grim picture of the likelihood that Roberts will get the medical assistant job she says she was promised.</p>\n<p>To encourage students to enroll, Corinthian routinely <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186739\">told prospective students</a> that they had job placement rates of 70%, often as high as 90%. But those were ‚Äúsubstantially and materially false,‚Äù according to allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit: In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186740\">one example</a>, a 72% placement rate was in fact 23%.</p>\n<p>In its lawsuit, the California attorney general‚Äôs office alleges that just a tiny fraction of the jobs Everest claimed it had placed students in, often around 30%, could be <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p13/a186748\">fully verified</a>. Most job placement records were ‚Äúmissing,‚Äù and for those records that could be found, the company routinely counted short-term positions as ‚Äúcareers‚Äù or included jobs that students were working outside of the fields they had trained for. One example <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p29/a186749\">cited in the suit</a> were dozens of students whose ‚Äúcareers‚Äù consisted of placements at health-screening fairs that lasted just two days.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn some cases,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p10/a186746\">the California suit reads,</a> ‚Äúthere is no evidence that a single student in a program obtained a job during the time frame specified.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations about falsified and misleading job placement rates are also at the center of the federal lawsuit, as well as suits in Wisconsin and Massachusetts and investigations in six other states. The lawsuit in Wisconsin alleges that in 2011, the actual job placement rate at Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee campus, which the company voluntarily shut down in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p14/a3\">was 5.5%</a>.</p>\n<p>Corinthian <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html\">strongly disputes</a> these allegations, saying that the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of Everest‚Äôs graduates find a job in their field. The company argues that the standards used to verify jobs in the Massachusetts suit, requiring job placements to be long-term, are <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html#document/p3/a186753\">not reflected in state law</a>. In the California suit, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357171-cci-response-to-california-attorney-general.html#document/p20/a186756\">Corinthian said</a>, the state selectively pulled from emails and internal documents to create ‚Äúout-of-context‚Äù and ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù impressions of the company‚Äôs job placement rates.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe have a vested interest in helping our graduates succeed in the job market,‚Äù said Jenkins. He added that Everest‚Äôs accreditation is tied to its ability to prove that its students are placed in jobs: It must submit job placement statistics and records to the school‚Äôs accrediting body.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits against the company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p26/a186759\">allege</a> that those numbers, too, were falsified.</p>\n<p>Students told me that Everest‚Äôs advertised job placement programs were limited to things like reviewing resumes and, in many cases, were all but nonexistent. Several students said that Everest staff had simply forwarded them Craigslist postings or referred them to classified ads in local newspapers. Many said they had been placed in temporary jobs, called ‚Äúexternships,‚Äù which were pre-arranged with employers and lasted anywhere from a few days to months. But once they graduated and the temporary internships the school had placed them in were over, students said, they were unable to get back in touch with job placement staff.</p>\n<p>For Mary Parks, who graduated from Everest in January, Everest‚Äôs ‚Äújob placement services‚Äù were limited to a single emailed job opportunity, a non-management internship at the retailer where she was already a cashier. After she told the school that she didn‚Äôt get the job, ‚ÄúI have not seen or heard from them since,‚Äù she said, despite emails to her caseworker. Parks has an associate degree in business management that cost $34,000, but is working a part-time job that pays just above minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Corinthian said it employs 600 career counselors for its 70,000 students, and that an internal corporate verification team checks the company‚Äôs job placement claims. ‚ÄúWe know of no traditional college or university that has made a remotely comparable commitment to career services,‚Äù said Jenkins. Community colleges generally have much lower graduation rates and lower employment rates, and employ just a handful of career counselors per 1,000 students.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that the company ‚Äúdoes not promise employment to students, period,‚Äù and does not directly provide students with information about salaries, instead referring them to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>Somehow, however, more than 50 students who contacted me came away from Everest with the impression that they had been ‚Äúpromised‚Äù jobs that they did not receive. Allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit against Corinthian back up the students‚Äô assertions: The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186613\">suit alleges</a> ‚ÄúCorinthian employees promised or guaranteed employment despite knowing it could not fulfill such promises.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the country‚Äôs biggest for-profit college lobbying group, argues that even if they fail to immediately find well-paying jobs after graduation, students leave Everest and other for-profit schools better off than when they entered: At least they have a degree or certification, and thus a chance at a better job.</p>\n<p>But an overwhelming majority of the students that I spoke to believe the opposite: They said, often fiercely, that they wished they had never enrolled.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was the worst decision of my life,‚Äù said Christine Gillan, who is $12,000 in debt for a medical assistant certificate she received in 2009. She never found a job in her field and now works as a cleaner at a health club.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad that I worked so hard and have nothing to show for it,‚Äù said Tiffany Jones, a mother of four who graduated from an Everest program in medical billing in Reseda, California, last year, but never found a job in her field. Jenkins, the Corinthian spokesman, said the school had made several efforts to reach out to Jones, which she did not respond to, and had ultimately helped her set up a job interview. Her experience, he said, ‚Äúdemonstrates that employers value an Everest education and were willing to interview her.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At that interview, Jones said, the employer asked her why she had wasted her money on an Everest education instead of a different, cheaper school. She didn‚Äôt get the job.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255438\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:description=\"‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3509316_4255438\" rel:via=\"molly_hc  \" rel:sub_title=\"‚ÄúI%20have%20nothing%20to%20show%20my%20children%20about%20why%20staying%20in%20s\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:19\" rel:count=\"7\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"\" style=\"font-family: 'News Cycle'; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.5000000000000004em; font-size: 28px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #224178; \">‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúMy husband and I are still struggling to keep food on the table, a roof over our heads, and our bills paid.

Everest <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p18/a186760\">consistently tells students</a> it is a ‚Äúnationally accredited school,‚Äù and many students assume that means their credits are transferable; some students said they were specifically told that their credits would transfer. But while Everest is nationally accredited, almost all nonprofit schools have regional accreditations, and accept few, if any, Everest credits. Transferring in most parts of the country is all but impossible.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said students must initial a paragraph in an enrollment document stating that transferability is out of Everest‚Äôs control and that students ‚Äúshould expect credits not to transfer.‚Äù He noted that national accreditation, which is designed specifically for career programs, has more stringent standards than regional accreditation, such as job placement and graduation requirements that community colleges do not have to meet.</p>\n<p>He also pointed to a single state, Florida, where thanks to a statewide course record system, a selection of Everest‚Äôs courses are transferable to public universities.</p>\n<p>The lack of credit transferability works in Everest‚Äôs favor, interviews with former students show. Students who become dissatisfied with the school partway through their education, or who realize months into their program how expensive the degree will be, have no choice but to stay, unable to take their credits to community colleges or public schools.</p>\n<p>And if they want to further their education by getting a more advanced degree, such as an associate or bachelor‚Äôs, students said they had no choice but to return to Everest, even if they were dissatisfied with their original programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255266\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"715\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 667px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255266','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Corinthian paid its CEO, Jack Massimino, more than $3 million in compensation last year, including a bonus of $1 million in what was the company‚Äôs worst fiscal year to date, according to SEC filings.

A prominent Democrat, he was the mayor of New Orleans for eight years and once sat on President Obama‚Äôs Equity and Excellence in Education Commission, which was tasked with addressing opportunities for the federal government to address educational inequality.</p>\n<p>In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Morial said, ‚ÄúI joined the Corinthian board as someone who is committed to civil rights and equal opportunity for all and who has spent a lifetime working to advance that mission‚Ä¶ As many institutions have increasingly shifted from extensive offerings of career and vocational training, a void has emerged across the country for students, especially non-traditional students, to have an opportunity to learn a trade and gain desirable workplace skills. The concept of increased vocational training to help fill this void is sound, and it absolutely must be delivered positively, ethically and within the law.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Another Corinthian director was Leon Panetta, the former secretary of defense, who sat on the board during the years of the school‚Äôs biggest growth, from 2008‚Äì2009. He left to join the Obama administration, then rejoined the board in 2013, a year after a <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">Senate report on for-profit colleges</a> found Corinthian to be among the worst performers in the industry, with student loan default rates higher than any other publicly traded company. He left the board after just 11 weeks, <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114041/leon-panetta-quits-corinthian-colleges-why\">facing pressure from critics</a> of Corinthian. Panetta declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>While the directors oversaw the business and were paid for their time, its owners were the biggest beneficiaries of its profits. One of the company‚Äôs largest shareholders has been Graham Holdings, formerly the Washington Post Company, which also owns Kaplan Inc., an education company and for-profit college chain.</p>\n<p>And throughout its troubled final years, Corinthian was supported by industry lobbyists, most notably the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, or APSCU. APSCU has been a force in Washington politics, most notably suing the Obama administration after a 2011 attempt to regulate the for-profit college industry, forcing the administration to revise the rules, delaying implementation for three years. Corinthian, an APSCU member, would have been among the hardest hit by those rules.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, taxpayers were the company‚Äôs largest supporter. Corinthian received 83% of its revenue from tax dollars at its enrollment peak in 2010, some $1.4 billion, and has raked in about $10 billion in the past 10 years. And it is taxpayers, through the federal student loan system, who will effectively act as debt collectors, chasing Everest‚Äôs former students for payment for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254364\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 999px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254364','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">California Attorney General Kamala Harris. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Eric Risberg / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In 2007, the California attorney general filed a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357643-california2007complaint-2.html\">lawsuit</a> against Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs parent company. California‚Äôs complaint against Everest and Corinthian included a litany of allegations: falsified job placement statistics, aggressive and unethical sales practices, and a pattern of jobless graduates carrying mountains of debt.</p>\n<p>But that case never went to trial: The lawsuit was immediately settled with no admission of wrongdoing on Corinthian‚Äôs part. The company paid a $500,000 civil penalty and $4.3 million in restitution to students at campuses that had notched the worst violations. As of this year, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on background, $3.4 million of that money has been paid out to 6,000 eligible students, for a total of approximately $560 each.</p>\n<p>Six years later, a new California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, filed a new lawsuit against Corinthian that was, for the most part, indistinguishable from the first complaint, detailing the same violations, alleging that the company had materially broken every agreement made in the previous settlement. The recent federal lawsuit, and those in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, trace similar lines.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education began <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-heightens-oversight-corinthian-colleges\">its own investigation</a> into Corinthian in January, requesting details on everything from the company‚Äôs job placement rates to financial aid practices. In June, it claimed Corinthian was taking too long to respond completely, and temporarily cut off the school‚Äôs access to the federal financial aid money that made up almost 90% of its revenue. Corinthian was so short on cash that even the 21-day delay sent them into a financial tailspin, threatening bankruptcy; the DOE eventually agreed to release the funds, but only on the condition that Corinthian would sell off or close all of its campuses within six months. The final list included only 12 schools that would be shut down; Corinthian plans to sell the other 85, likely to a private equity firm or a for-profit competitor.</p>\n<p>But the lawsuits, investigations, and even the Department of Education‚Äôs forced shutdown are unlikely to result in any real change for the vast majority of Everest‚Äôs current and former students. One of the deep ironies of Corinthian‚Äôs collapse is that there are, experts say, effectively too many victims for there to be any reasonable way to compensate them, or to actually shut down the dozens of Everest campuses. It would cost the government billions to forgive the outstanding debt of former students, and any attempt to shut down Corinthian‚Äôs schools would displace 70,000 current ones.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seeks debt relief for students ‚Äî but only on a tiny fraction of loans, those made directly by Corinthian, not the federal loans that make up the vast majority of students‚Äô debt. Lawsuits in California, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts may provide some restitution to former students in those states, but like the 2007 settlement, would do little more than chip away at students‚Äô loan tallies.</p>\n<p>Corinthian College‚Äôs impending demise will likely work against former students, said Pauline Abernathy, the vice president of policy organization The Institute for College Access and Success. ‚ÄúThe issue is, if [the government] were to win a lawsuit, where would the money come from to compensate students?‚Äù Abernathy said.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs all but impossible that any real money will come from Corinthian. Corinthian is so cash-strapped that it has been selling off assets ‚Äî even equipment belonging to its chain of automotive schools ‚Äî just to stay afloat until it finds a buyer for its campuses. It is extremely unlikely, experts agree, that any state would be able to recover a substantial settlement from the company.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe chances are slim‚Äù that former students will ever see any kind of meaningful debt relief, said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the advocacy group Center for Responsible Lending.</p>\n<p>And because all former students signed arbitration agreements, Dundon said, they are unable to take part in class-action lawsuits in open court, and must instead take their cases to arbitration. That can be problematic because arbitration suits are difficult to file, and, in a more business-friendly environment, do not carry with them the right to appeal. ‚ÄúThe worst thing is that the process is not public, so you can‚Äôt find out what the allegations are,‚Äù said Dundon.</p>\n<p>In the years between when the two lawsuits were filed in California, Everest boomed, reaching a height of 113,000 students in 2010. That was the year immediately after the economic crisis, when students flocked to for-profit schools in search of jobs. Enrollments ‚Äî and revenues ‚Äî fell sharply beginning in 2010, and Corinthian‚Äôs stock price slid alongside it. In 2009, the company was valued at around $1.4 billion. In the wake of the Education Department‚Äôs shutdown, its shares have been trading at around 18 cents, valuing the business at $14 million ‚Äî just $2.5 million more than the asking price of Massimino‚Äôs house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255398\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"759\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 711px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255398','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jose Luis Magana / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Many Everest students who contacted me had deep misconceptions about the most basic financial aspects of their expensive educations, from the amount of tuition to who was shouldering the cost of their degree. Kelli McClendon, a former student of Everest College Online, wrote: ‚ÄúI was getting $5500 financial aid. The course was only $4500. Yet I found out I still had to take out loans to pay for my classes.‚Äù The cost of McClendon‚Äôs program was actually $13,500 ‚Äî she had been told the cost for one quarter, rather than three.</p>\n<p>The students who told me that they were misled about the nature of their debts had all ostensibly gone through financial aid counseling, signing papers that listed the amount of money they were borrowing and the interest rates on their loans. That‚Äôs a government-mandated process, designed to ensure students understand the implications of the debt they are about to enter into.</p>\n<p>But interviews with former students and employees show Everest‚Äôs version of that process <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p34/a186789\">obscured the full cost of its education</a> and sometimes even led students to believe that they were not borrowing money at all. Some said their loans were misrepresented as grants that would not have to be repaid. Students said they were given a ‚Äútuition cost‚Äù that was per quarter or per credit, apparently without explaining that distinction. Others were told they would ‚Äúpay nothing out of pocket,‚Äù or that the school would help them find ‚Äúgovernment-sector jobs‚Äù where they would not have to repay their loans.</p>\n<p>Failing to provide complete program costs to students is in violation of Corinthian‚Äôs policies, said Jenkins. ‚ÄúAny suggestion that clear information about the cost of programs is not made available to prospective students is demonstrably false,‚Äù he said. He pointed to Corinthian‚Äôs website, where, he said, ‚ÄúYou can see that anyone can visit one of our websites and get the precise cost of any program and the availability of grants and loans to cover that cost.‚Äù (<a href=\"http://www.everest.edu/campus/chesapeake/program/criminal-justice\">This</a> is the type of page most students would navigate to find out program costs.)</p>\n<p>Admissions personnel were never allowed to discuss financial aid directly with students, according to the first former admissions representative ‚Äî ‚Äúthey would fire you on the spot if you mentioned financial aid‚Äù ‚Äî but were instead told to promise students that, once they had signed initial enrollment papers, they would be given financial aid counseling. But more often than not, she said, students left that single counseling session confused about what they had signed. ‚ÄúA couple days into class, I‚Äôd often get calls from students I enrolled saying, ‚ÄòI think I took out a loan? I don‚Äôt understand, what did this mean?‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut you couldn‚Äôt answer. You could only give them the runaround and say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt have to pay it back until after you graduate.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Often, the admissions representative said, and especially with students who spoke limited English, ‚ÄúI got the impression they didn‚Äôt know what they were signing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Though they were presented with papers that would have explained the terms and amounts of the grants and loans they were taking out, many students said they were not given time to read the papers. They instead trusted the words of their financial aid counselors, who promised to ‚Äúexplain everything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One former financial aid counselor at Everest College-Phoenix said she and other representatives ‚Äúnever discussed anything about the total cost of attendance‚Äù with students. When total costs came up, students were quickly assured they would be ‚Äúcovered by financial aid.‚Äù By the end of a single phone call with online students, the financial aid counselor said, she had signed students up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without the student‚Äôs full understanding of what they had agreed to.</p>\n<p>Everest educations are expensive: More than five times as expensive as a degree from a community college, and twice as expensive as a degree from a state university. The cost is no accident; it‚Äôs largely a by-product of a federal rule governing for-profit colleges, known as ‚Äúthe 90/10 rule,‚Äù which mandates that schools can draw a maximum of 90% of their revenue from federal aid money.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs tuition is set at a price high enough that some students eventually max out their federal aid, forcing them to turn to other sources to pay for the final slice of their tuition, often around $5,000. Usually, that ‚Äúfunding gap‚Äù is covered by a private loan made by Everest itself, called a Genesis loan, which charges a maximum of 9.9% interest, nearly twice as much as an unsubsidized loan made by the federal government.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students said that they were not informed ahead of time that they would need to take out private loans in addition to government funding. Most said they were told within months or even weeks of graduation that they had ‚Äúrun out of funding, and that if they wanted to graduate, they would need to sign up for a Genesis loan.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins noted that less than 40% of Corinthian‚Äôs students take out private loans. ‚ÄúThis program was never intended to be and has never been a profit center,‚Äù he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255314\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"873\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 825px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255314','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Paula Dougherty, who is studying business administration at Everest, lives in rural Warrior, Alabama. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Paula Dougherty isn‚Äôt sure how much money she‚Äôs paying for a two-year associate degree in business administration at Everest University Online; she was never told, and she never asked.

For-profit colleges say they offer poor and working students things that public and nonprofit colleges cannot: job-centric degrees, flexible course schedules for single parents and full-time workers, environments geared toward older students and veterans rather than recent high school graduates.</p>\n<p>The numbers behind the industry as a whole are troubling: Just 13% of American higher-education students attend for-profit colleges, but they account for 30% of all outstanding student loans ‚Äî and almost half of student loan defaults. The graduation rate stands at 32%. But the for-profit college industry defends those figures by saying they are explained by the schools‚Äô demographics: Studies have shown poor students are less likely to graduate, and it stands to reason that they have to borrow much more too. They also frequently compare themselves to community colleges, where graduation rates are actually lower and loan default rates often equally as high.</p>\n<p>Community colleges are significantly less expensive: an average of $8,500 vs. $35,000, meaning that only 42% of community college students are forced to go into debt for two-year degrees, compared with more than 88% of for-profit college students. They borrow, on average, twice as much as community college students.</p>\n<p>The for-profit college industry has also come under fire for much more than its student borrowing and graduation rates. Corinthian is widely known as being among the worst offenders in the industry, but it‚Äôs far from alone in its record of legal action. In January, attorneys general in 12 states announced investigations into the practices of three massive publicly traded for-profits: EDMC, ITT Educational Services, and Career Education Corporation. EDMC, which recently delisted itself from the stock exchange, faced a similar investigation in 2010; the 55,000-student ITT Educational is being investigated by the SEC and sued, like Corinthian, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\n<p>The University of Phoenix, the country‚Äôs largest and best-known for-profit, has been investigated in several different states. It <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/university-phoenix-settles-false-claims-act-lawsuit-675-million\">settled with the Justice Department</a> over its recruiting practices for $67 million in 2009, after a government review, according to the <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/0914apollo14.html\"><i>Arizona Republic</i></a>, ‚Äúpaint[ed] a picture of a school so hungry to enroll new students that it has threatened and intimidated its recruitment staff in meetings and e-mail, pressured them to enroll unqualified students and covered up its practices to deceive regulators.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For its part, the Obama administration has tried ‚Äî and, so far, failed ‚Äî to impose meaningful regulations on the industry. In 2011, the administration rolled out a series of so-called ‚Äúgainful-employment‚Äù regulations meant to shut down the worst-performing career college programs. Programs were required to meet one of two metrics relating to loan repayment and debt-to-income ratios. Those that failed were disproportionately for-profit college programs.</p>\n<p>Many critics of the industry actually regarded the 2011 regulations as too lax, criticizing the administration for bowing to the demands of for-profit college lobbyists. The most prominent for-profit lobby group sued the Education Department anyway, and the rules were thrown out on a technical argument that the metrics chosen by the department were arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Last week, the administration released a new version of the regulations that, though tougher than the 2011 iteration, caved in to a key lobbying demand by the for-profit college industry. Some lawmakers are skeptical the new regulations will work as hoped. ‚ÄúI do not believe that this rule will be enough to prevent bad actors in the for-profit sector from gaming the system and taking advantage of our students,‚Äù said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat, in a statement. APSCU, the for-profit college lobbying organization, has already filed a lawsuit to strike down the new attempt at regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255297\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1019px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255297','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A photograph of Jennifer Wilson at her graduation from Everest. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph Molly Hensley-Clancey for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Jennifer Wilson still keeps a framed portrait in her living room of herself at graduation, beaming in a cap and gown and holding a leather folder that reads ‚ÄúEverest University‚Äù against her chest. She was so happy in that moment, she said: She had finally graduated from college ‚Äî a dream she‚Äôd had since she was a teenager ‚Äî with an associate of science degree in criminal justice. She was on her way, she hoped, to a better job.</p>\n<p>But Wilson, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, was yet to understand the extent of the debt she was carrying. ‚ÄúI had no idea how much my loans were coming to,‚Äù she said; she had been rushed through the signing process without anybody mentioning the total cost of her program. Weeks after graduation, she started getting bills for the rest of her student loan debt. The total cost of her two-year associate degree: $40,000.</p>\n<p>She would soon find her degree was essentially ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù she said, and came with none of the job placement services she‚Äôd been promised. No police departments would hire her, although she‚Äôd been told her program had a near-perfect job placement rate; it was 2010, so some blamed the economy, but others said it was because of the quality of her degree.</p>\n<p>At her local community college, Wilson learned, a similar two-year degree would have cost around $7,000.</p>\n<p>By then, the joy of that Everest cap-and-gown moment was long gone. It had begun to fade even on graduation day. As she walked off the stage that afternoon, she opened the embossed folder for a first look at her diploma; instead, she found a letter from Everest, demanding that she pay $3,000 in private loans she still owed the school. Until she paid up, she wouldn‚Äôt officially graduate or receive her diploma. With a salary of $25,000 a year, it would take her three years, and a loan from her mother, to come up with the money.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI hated myself,‚Äù Wilson said, her voice catching as she spoke. She is still working in the same job she had when she graduated. ‚ÄúI thought, <i>I am</i> so <i>much smarter than this</i>.

In the <i>New York Times</i>, Michael Sr. came off as a callous homophobe when he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want my grandkids raised in that kind of environment. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm old school. I‚Äôm a man-and-a-woman type of guy.‚Äù When the ESPN documentary declared that Michael Sr. had ‚Äúabandoned the family‚Äù and left his mother to raise Michael Jr. and his seven siblings on her own, Michael Sr. seemed the archetype of the intolerant and absent black father.</p>\n<p>In none of these accounts did Michael Jr. come to his father‚Äôs defense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to my friends than I am to my family,‚Äù Michael Jr. told the <i>T</i><i>imes</i>.</p>\n<p>But the father-son story of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. is more than a conflict over whether Michael Sr. loved and supported his son. It‚Äôs the tale of man who‚Äôs been reduced to a caricature but whose actual life was shaped by the loss of child after child, some to death and some to crime. The rift between Michael Sr. and his youngest son started long before Michael Jr. came out and stems in no small part from those family tragedies.</p>\n<p>Of course, those losses shaped Michael Jr. too, but he isn‚Äôt saying how. Through his agent and publicist, he declined numerous requests for an interview. But it‚Äôs not hard to see how, in order to succeed and perhaps just to survive, he might blame his father, fairly or not, for what happened to his family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240900\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1407\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1324px; top: 432px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240900','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Joel Anderson/BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Michael Sr. spends most of his days at the DeSoto Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 15 miles southwest of Dallas.

He wears a gold chain around his broad neck, which bears a deep and long surgical scar that runs from the bottom of his hairline to somewhere past the neckline of his white undershirt. It‚Äôs not clear he knows exactly what ailment has left him in a wheelchair. ‚ÄúI have a hole in my neck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I ain‚Äôt gonna die in this motherfucker.

He has a paunch and false teeth, but he still possesses the thickly muscled shoulders and arms of someone nicknamed ‚ÄúHammer,‚Äù a handle he got on the football field and in the streets. His hands still make large fists; kicking ass was a family pastime.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaaaannnn, I used to hit hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI taught all my sons to play football.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He often rolls his wheelchair to a shaded patio, where he goes through Kool cigarettes like some people do cups of coffee. He banters with almost everyone. Especially the women. ‚ÄúBetter quit bending that ass over like that,‚Äù he tells one of the women staffers, a smile creasing his fleshy face. The woman smiles back. If she or other women staffers are offended by his behavior, they don‚Äôt show it.

On May 10, the St. Louis Rams drafted him, generating more praise. But despite the fact that he had been a star at the University of Missouri, where he became Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the powerful Southeastern Conference, he was chosen late. Only seven players were selected after him. He performed well during training camp and the preseason ‚Äî but was still cut from the final roster on Aug. 30, touching off a debate about whether homophobia played a role in his release. The Cowboys signed him three days later to their practice squad, then dropped him on Oct. 21. He is now a free agent.</p>\n<p>For the nearly two months that Michael Jr. was with the Cowboys, he lived a half hour away from his father. It was the closest they‚Äôve lived to each other in about 15 years. A family friend, Sean Woods, hoped it would finally bring the men together. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, Michael Jr. ‚Äúhas to deal with his daddy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet the Michaels have exchanged only a few text messages and haven‚Äôt spoken a word to each other, a quiet that has now lasted at least several months with no end in sight. Michael Sr. has mostly kept up with the vicissitudes of his son‚Äôs career through updates on ESPN and phone calls from friends and family members.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Michael Jr. was released from the Cowboys‚Äô practice squad, Michael Sr. sent a text to BuzzFeed News: ‚ÄúHey they cut Mike.‚Äù Asked if he‚Äôd heard from his son recently, Michael Sr. texted back that Michael Jr. ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt say a word to me honer [sic] thy father.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he was looking for an excuse to separate from us,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre just letting him have his limelight. We‚Äôre tired of begging him to stay in the family.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the room‚Äôs walls, Michael Sr. has pinned Father‚Äôs Day cards, a corkboard with a calendar and pictures of his family, and, over his bed, a lengthy poem about angels.

In 1947, he was living in Opelousas, Louisiana, when he heard on the radio about what‚Äôs generally considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_disaster#Scale_of_the_disaster\">the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history</a>, an explosion at the Monsanto plant near Galveston, Texas. He headed right to the scene, figuring he could get work there.</p>\n<p>He loaded cotton at the Galveston wharves for a few months before landing a job at the Monsanto plant. Yes, it had blown up, killing nearly 600 people, but he could make more money there than a black man could expect almost anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He married Alberta, a fellow Opelousas native who spoke Creole, little English, and who couldn‚Äôt read or write. With their 10 children, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 1732 Thompson St. in La Marque: Wesley and Alberta had a bedroom, the girls had one, and the boys had the room at the back of the house. ‚ÄúI had a white boy type of life at home,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt nothing I couldn‚Äôt have wanted and gotten.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Alberta died at 46 following ‚Äúa brief illness,‚Äù according to her obituary in the <i>La Marque Times</i>. Wesley Sam was a loving man, a capable cook, and obsessive about cleanliness ‚Äî he would dust off his car every day, his surviving children said. But he wasn‚Äôt quite up to the challenge of corralling all of those children. Who could? Instead he set his example through his work ethic, putting in a full day at Monsanto then mowing lawns with his sons in the evening. They‚Äôd do 18 yards a day, Wednesday through Sunday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy dad was a workaholic before anyone called it that,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd think you were sorry if you didn‚Äôt have that work mentality in you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr.‚Äôs siblings went off to college, joined the military, and found middle-class jobs. His sister Geraldine would become La Marque‚Äôs first black mayor.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr., meanwhile, dropped out of school over the protests of his father but earned a GED. He wasn‚Äôt much of a student anyway, and finding work in the area was a cinch for anyone who didn‚Äôt mind getting a few smudges on their shirt. He worked in construction, at a chemical plant, and as a crane operator and a forklift operator.</p>\n<p>Away from work, Michael Sr. and his brothers drank, chased women, and kept up the family tradition of fisticuffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be out in the front yard fighting,‚Äù Michael Sr. said, grinning at the memory. ‚ÄúReal fighting. Not no slapboxing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One night in 1978, Michael Sr. met a woman named JoAnn Turner at a local nightclub. ‚ÄúShe was fine and good-looking,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I walked her out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Little more than a year later, JoAnn gave birth to a boy they named Russell. A year later, they had daughter Chanel. Julian was born in June 1982. They were young and in love, with three kids and jobs that paid middle-class wages. It didn‚Äôt take long for Michael Sr. to settle into life as a family man, or long for it to be destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4241207\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"697\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 649px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4241207','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs a news brief from the Associated Press on Sept. 23, 1982, with a dateline from Texas City: ‚ÄúThe body of Chanel Roshaun Sam was found Monday night in about eight feet of water near a pier on which she had been playing. Her parents and neighbors searched for three hours before finding the body.‚Äù The little girl, 2 years old, had apparently drowned.</p>\n<p>After several days of grief, and desperate to rescue JoAnn from her despair, Michael Sr. suggested they go to the courthouse. And so, six days after their daughter died, they were married.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt like she needed some support,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was the right thing to do, to bring something positive from it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt enough. JoAnn turned to religion and became a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. Her conversion deepened the fissure in her marriage, because Michael Sr. was raised as a Baptist and felt his wife‚Äôs new religion was too restrictive. She insisted the family not celebrate Christmas. ‚ÄúI celebrated it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt celebrate it with me. I still bought the kids gifts.‚Äù (JoAnn didn‚Äôt respond to requests for an interview.)</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. found his solace shooting dice. On Friday and Saturday evenings, he would take his paycheck to a little wooden shack in Texas City and gamble away the family‚Äôs money. JoAnn suspected the absences were because of another woman, Michael Sr. said. But a mutual friend of the couple gave her the scoop. In Michael Sr.‚Äôs version of the story, the woman told JoAnn that ‚Äúhe ain‚Äôt screwing none of us‚Äù but was just gambling.</p>\n<p>One Friday night, Michael Sr. recalled, he won $700 and left the shack with two friends on an impromptu trip to Boy‚Äôs Town in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, an infamous red-light district just across the Texas border. He didn‚Äôt bother calling JoAnn to tell her that he was leaving town.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt no cell phones back then, and I didn‚Äôt stop and spend the 25 cents to call,‚Äù he said. When he returned Sunday, ‚Äúshe bitched at my ass. But it was pretty funny. I had a blast.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage continued to spiral, though Joshua was born in 1984 and Christopher in 1985. Michael Sr. finally filed for divorce in February 1986. A brief attempt at reconciliation resulted in the birth of Michelle in 1987. But the divorce was granted in 1988.</p>\n<p>JoAnn was awarded primary parental responsibilities. Michael Sr. would have access to the children two weekends each month, and they divided up the holidays.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. was also ordered to pay JoAnn $250 each month for child support. Within a few months, JoAnn returned to court to complain that Michael Sr. wasn‚Äôt meeting his obligation. Thus started a four-year battle over child support. Michael Sr. was charged with contempt of court at least 10 times stemming from his failure to pay, according to court records. Twice he was sent to county jail.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242796\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 392px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242796','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">The District Clerk's Office of Galveston County</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúIt was because I was running around and spending money and shooting dice,‚Äù Michael Sr. said.

He was breaking into the back door when the homeowner fired at him three times through a metal door. Russell was clutching a screwdriver when his body was found. No charges were filed against the homeowner (who was also black).</p>\n<p>The anger welled up within Michael Sr., who casually knew the man who had killed his son. There weren‚Äôt many strangers on that side of town. Michael Sr. got himself a handgun. ‚ÄúI was going to kill him,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI was going to go over there and end him. But my daddy saved me. He wouldn‚Äôt let me go over there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>His father saved him<i>.</i> But Michael Sr. couldn‚Äôt save his own sons.</p>\n<p>At 5 feet 4 inches and 125 pounds, second-oldest son Julian had an unusually slight build for a Sam boy. He went by the nickname ‚ÄúIce Pick.‚Äù But he had a left arm that was made for pitching. ‚ÄúThat boy could throw,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe used to strike Russell out all the time. Those were the funnest days.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But, Michael Sr. said, ‚Äúhe wanted his own money‚Äù and begged his father to let him work.

She told the newspaper that she wanted him to come home or at least call someone in the family to let them know he was OK.</p>\n<p>In grief, Michael Sr. had quit his job at the post office. ‚ÄúI had always had a steady job, but I couldn‚Äôt handle it no more,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt closed in. Just thinking of it.‚Äù He found work as a crane operator but was laid off soon after. He got a job working for a local pipe company and was let go again. Finally, in the fall of 1999, a family friend told him he should consider truck driving. Michael Sr. went to school in Dallas, and four months later was on the road, coming back to Hitchcock when he could, mostly on weekends.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a steady job,‚Äù he said, and one that answered a deeper need: ‚ÄúI had to get away. I wanted to get away.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage crumbled. Michael Sr. and JoAnn remain legally married but haven‚Äôt lived as a couple since he moved to Dallas in 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was 10 when his father started his life on the road. With JoAnn working late hours and taking extra shifts to provide for the children, Michael Jr.‚Äôs older brothers had their run of the house ‚Äî and the streets. ‚ÄúIt was bad,‚Äù Michael Jr. said in an ESPN documentary about his life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a kid and I‚Äôm seeing some hardcore drugs in my house. My mother didn‚Äôt know about it. If I told her anything, my brothers said they would kill me.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Craig Smith, one of his high school football coaches, saw it for himself. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôd drive over to pick him up and honk the horn and one of his brothers would come out to see if I wanted to buy‚Äù drugs, he told a crowd at the school‚Äôs annual football reunion dinner in late July.</p>\n<p>The criminal records of Michael Jr.‚Äôs brothers support these accounts: Josh has been arrested more than 40 times, including four convictions for drug possession, and Chris has tallied nearly 20 arrests.</p>\n<p>In April, Chris was sentenced to 30 years in state prison for breaking into a woman‚Äôs home, choking her into unconsciousness twice, then using her credit card at a nearby restaurant. Josh was put in the Galveston County Jail in July on a minor offense and was released last month.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI got caught up in them streets,‚Äù Josh admitted during a June interview with BuzzFeed News, a rare evening this year when he wasn‚Äôt locked up.</p>\n<p>Little of this came as a surprise to family members. Cousins remember being warned to keep their distance. ‚ÄúWe knew it wasn‚Äôt the ideal upbringing,‚Äù said Joseph Sam, a nephew of Michael Sr. ‚ÄúThey were always in trouble.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With his childhood saturated with grief and his older brothers descending into crime, Michael Jr. would have had to be a saint not to look for someone to blame. Conveniently, his father was already blaming himself.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, far away from home, Michael Sr. remained tormented by the loss of his boys. Teaching them toughness had backfired; he‚Äôd armed them with tools for survival in one world that wouldn‚Äôt work in almost any other.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLife was going to be tough on them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour skin had to be tougher than the others. But I also wanted them to make the right decisions.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Somewhere in these years, Michael Sr. began to lose the last of his sons ‚Äî not to death or crime, but to rejection.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242977\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-6687-1415827301-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242977','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-6687-1415827301-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Robert Dohman</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>On his first day of third grade, in a new town and new school, Michael Jr. was seated next to a chubby, snowy-haired boy. Michael Jr. wasn‚Äôt saying much to his new seatmate. The silence went on for so long and got so awkward that eventually the boy spoke up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI told the teacher that I didn‚Äôt want to sit next to him because he was too quiet,‚Äù said Robert Dohman. ‚ÄúHe turns around and goes, ‚ÄòHey, blondie boy, I‚Äôm not quiet!‚Äô And that‚Äôs the way me and Michael get along now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was voted ‚Äúfriendliest‚Äù by his sixth-grade classmates and elected homecoming king in eighth grade. His popularity was a testament to his ability to navigate the unspoken color line of a small Southern town; most of his close friends were white.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy grandma,‚Äù said Dohman, ‚Äúwas very old-school and wasn‚Äôt into all that racial mixing. But when I had Michael over, he‚Äôd always be the first one to come over and give everybody a hug. Even her. He really changed the way my grandmother looked at black people. She would even smile when he came around.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he saw little of the outgoing side of his son, saying he was quiet at home. But coaches and teachers remember him as a precociously self-assured teenager who could start a conversation with anyone. After football games, Michael Jr. was known for going into the bleachers ‚Äî uniform and pads still on ‚Äî to introduce himself to parents.</p>\n<p>Michael could ‚Äútalk to a group of 15-year-olds and then set there and talk to a group of 55-year-olds and not feel out of place either,‚Äù said Smith, now head football coach at Hitchcock. ‚ÄúI just never had a student that could just go and talk to a group of people. He would make friends all the time.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even in what was ostensibly enemy territory. Smith recalled a track meet at Danbury, a nearby town that is 90% white, less than 1% black, and had developed a reputation for being unfriendly to minorities. Except, apparently, Michael Jr.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can remember some Danbury parents cheering and rooting for Michael running the 100-meter‚Äù dash, Coach Smith said. ‚ÄúYou just didn‚Äôt see that, if you know anything about Danbury.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Maybe the biggest benefit of playing sports is that it kept Michael Jr. away from his brothers. The coaches, who also worked as teachers in the district, knew all about Josh and Chris: Their obvious athleticism had never proven to be worth the trouble. But Michael Jr. was charting a path different from the men in his family. Michael Jr. greeted people with hugs, not fists. He was going to be the first to graduate.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMichael was a good kid,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe said he didn‚Äôt want to be like his brothers.‚Äù Left unsaid was that Michael Jr. clearly felt the same about his father.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243125\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243125','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Robert Dohman</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>On fall Friday nights, Michael Sr. said he would find a seat somewhere in Hitchcock‚Äôs football stadium, away from the crowd and sometimes with his father, Wesley. After nearly 30 years as a father, he said, he could finally engage in the autumn ritual familiar across Texas.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt miss [any] home game his senior year,‚Äù Michael Sr. insisted.</p>\n<p>There isn‚Äôt anyone who can corroborate his perfect attendance. Family and friends say they‚Äôre sure he went to some games but don‚Äôt know about all of them. The coaches at Hitchcock High can remember seeing or, rather, hearing, Michael Sr. only once in four years: a game in Michael Jr.‚Äôs sophomore year.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI heard this guy yelling at Michael and I turned to Michael and asked him, ‚ÄòWho the hell is that guy?‚Äô‚Äù Smith recalled. ‚ÄúMichael said it was his father. That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve ever seen him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Those stadiums can be hubs of activity on Friday nights, and coaches are notoriously focused on the events unfolding well away from the stands. It would be easy to miss someone on game night, <i>right</i>?</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet me say this in a nice way,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know him, and I know a lot of people in town. I can look up in those stands and know who‚Äôs there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he didn‚Äôt make it a priority to spend any time with the parents of Michael Jr.‚Äôs friends or the alums and other regulars who would show up at school events ‚Äî most of them white. ‚ÄúI never did know them,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I never tried to go out of my way.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he took a job with a trucking company based out of Ada, Oklahoma, so that he could arrive in Hitchcock by the start of kickoff Friday night. He assumed his son appreciated what he considered a significant sacrifice of time and money; coming back to Texas without a load meant he wouldn‚Äôt get paid for the drive home.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until earlier this year, when media outlets began saying that he had abandoned his son, that Michael Sr. learned he was being phased out of the story of his son‚Äôs childhood. He never thought all those years on the road would mean that he wasn‚Äôt there.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMichael‚Äôs family was the city of Hitchcock,‚Äù said Dohman, Michael Jr.‚Äôs childhood friend.</p>\n<p>Told what Dohman said, Michael Sr. looked straight ahead, the anger washing over him. Sitting on that patio at the nursing home, he was, for a few moments, that angry Sam boy ready to fight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock didn‚Äôt buy his goddamn clothes, a roof over his head, or the bed that he slept in,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock can kiss my ass.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúI should have kept those gas receipts.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Of course, Michael Sr. never thought he would need them. He also never thought the family of a high school teammate ‚Äî a white one ‚Äî would get so much credit.</p>\n<p>Once Michael Jr. revealed in February his plans to become the NFL‚Äôs first out gay player, the two media outlets with which his publicists coordinated the announcement wrote this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/sports/football/for-nfl-prospect-michael-sam-upbringing-was-bigger-challenge-than-coming-out-as-gay.html?_r=1\">The <i>New York Times</i></a>: Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank. Ron‚Äôs wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sam‚Äôs senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls‚Äô house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags. ‚ÄúI look at our house as a kind of safe haven,‚Äù said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. ‚ÄúHe is just another son. If he did something wrong, he got yelled at just like the others did.‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10453954/michael-sam-safe-havens-football-surrogate-family\">ESPN</a>: The relationship started when Candy Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs wife, invited Michael to dinner during his freshman year of high school. Ronnie, a man with a personality much bigger than he is, discovered a kid he didn‚Äôt recognize and demanded to know, ‚ÄúAnd who are you?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWithout skipping a beat, my brother replied, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Michael Alan Sam Jr.!,‚Äô‚Äù said Ethan Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúAnd after that, he never left.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bunch of shit,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. Sure, he said, his son went to the Purls‚Äô on weekends, but ‚ÄúMichael lived at home to the day he graduated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe lived with the rest of us,‚Äù agreed Michael Jr.‚Äôs sister Michelle.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Purls only helped [him] in [his] senior year,‚Äù his aunt Geraldine said. ‚ÄúIf the Purls were really good people, they‚Äôd tell Michael that he was wrong.

How else to explain Vito coming home for the holidays? Michael Sr. waited until they returned to Missouri to broach his suspicions to his wife. ‚ÄúI told JoAnn, ‚ÄòYou know, Mike ain‚Äôt bring his girlfriend but he brought this dude.

I told my brother that that boy right there is gay.‚Äù</p>\n<p>When they went out for dinner later that night, Michael Jr. showed them a picture of a woman he said he was dating; Michael Jr.‚Äôs Instagram account has lots of pictures of him in college posing with young women.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI still had some suspicions,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. But other family members ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna believe it. I had intuition about that boy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That intuition was finally confirmed this year. On Feb. 4, Michael Sr.‚Äôs birthday, he received a text message from his son. ‚ÄúI could tell his PR guy wrote that message because Mike don‚Äôt talk like that,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was some bullshit. ‚ÄòI wanted to inform you that I‚Äôm gay.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got to say?‚Äù Michael Sr. remembered texting Michael Jr. in response. ‚ÄúHe texted me back, ‚ÄòHappy birthday.‚Äô So I went out and got drunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Five months later, in his room at the nursing home watching the red carpet show before his son would receive the Arthur Ashe Award, Michael Sr. grew wildly upset. He started calling and texting family members and friends.</p>\n<p>With Vito at his side, Michael Jr. had been asked what was the most difficult part of coming out. He told the interviewer that it was telling his friends. Michael Sr. was incensed.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf it was so hard to tell his friends, why didn‚Äôt he tell us first?‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was harder for him to tell us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And it probably was. One recent afternoon, Michael Sr.‚Äôs brother Charles asked if Michael Jr. might go back to women. Michael Sr. responded, ‚ÄúWomen don‚Äôt really want to mess with you after doing all that gay shit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. is never going to be the spokesman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. He‚Äôs not thrilled about his son‚Äôs sexual orientation. But he also hasn‚Äôt disowned his son. He never says his son is going to hell. He doesn‚Äôt talk about trying to cure him or make him straight. In his own rough-hewn, coarse way, Michael Sr. has accepted that his son is gay. ‚ÄúI love my son,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt care about what he do.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243564\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243564','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Buckner / Getty Images For ESPYS</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The family rift that the ESPY Awards exposed to a national audience had been there, deep and wide, for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243442\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 302px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243442','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Will Ebner </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://L.G\">L.G</a>.

Instead of asking his family to attend as guests, he invited the family of Missouri football teammate Will Ebner.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe found out Will and I were going to be part of his family representing him,‚Äù said Elaine Ebner, mother of Will Ebner. ‚ÄúIf someone else had come from his family, I would have wanted them to be center stage. I know my place. Mainly, I just wanted to be whatever he wanted me to be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Jr.‚Äôs aunt Geraldine managed to score tickets from a friend who was a member of the Rotary Club. She also sat in the area designated for family. ‚ÄúWhen I got there, [Michael Jr.] was glad to see me. It‚Äôs always good to have family there,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Days later, Michael Jr. graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in parks, recreation, and tourism. Everyone in the family ‚Äî except Josh and Chris, who were both in jail ‚Äî made the 600-mile road trip from Texas to celebrate the first of JoAnn‚Äôs and Michael Sr.‚Äôs children to graduate from college.</p>\n<p>To commemorate the occasion, Michael Jr. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/h6w1JOG8Zk/?modal=true\">posted a picture on Instagram</a> of himself in a cap and gown, a wide smile on his face and an elbow comfortably resting on the mantle of a fireplace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming,‚Äù read his caption. He was alone in the photo and made no mention of anyone else being there ‚Äî in that or any of his other public social media posts from the time.</p>\n<p>Later in December, during the week of the Cotton Bowl in Dallas ‚Äî Michael Jr.‚Äôs final college game ‚Äî Michael Sr. said his son borrowed his car and spent all of his time with Vito and teammates. Michael Sr. also said his son lied to him about the location of the team hotel and then didn‚Äôt call him, or return any of his calls, for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had to call him to get him to bring me my car back,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI kept calling and calling. He didn‚Äôt bring the car until the last day, and the game was the next day. He didn‚Äôt talk to me or nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In May, on the weekend of the NFL draft, Michael Jr.‚Äôs family was conspicuously absent when TV cameras followed him around at his agent‚Äôs home in San Diego. He declined an offer from his father‚Äôs family members to attend a draft party they wanted to host in Dallas, his aunt Geraldine and Michael Sr. said. Instead, he spent the weekend in California with Vito, some friends, and his agents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs so ashamed of us,‚Äù Geraldine remembers one of his sisters telling her, ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt he just change his name?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The day the Rams drafted him ‚Äî when he was so happy that he kissed Vito and smeared his face with celebratory cake ‚Äî might end up being the pinnacle of Michael Jr.‚Äôs NFL career. Now, cut from his second team, he is learning something his father learned long ago: Life can take what you want most.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, <i>Outsports</i> noted, every single Defensive Player of the Year from the five major college football conferences made it onto an NFL team ‚Äî except Michael Sam Jr. And it‚Äôs not that he played poorly in preseason. Far from it. He totaled 11 tackles and three sacks, a figure that left him tied for fourth in the league. His bold announcement of his sexuality, which garnered him glamorous accolades, may have also destroyed his football career.</p>\n<p>Disappointment and loss are feelings Michael Sr. knows well, of course, so the two Michaels have more in common now than they may have ever had. And yet Michael Jr. doesn‚Äôt come to his father ‚Äî or anyone in his family ‚Äî for comfort. He keeps his distance.</p>\n<p>To Michael Sr., sitting in his wheelchair or taking a drag on one of his Kools, that distance can feel like death. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose another son.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243647\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"441\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 393px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243647','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 12:06:57.016787"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/the-two-michael-sams"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-15738-1415729730-34.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-13"], ["title", "The Two Michael¬†Sams"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 12:06:57.016787"]]

In statements to authorities <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">out</a> of court, and in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News, Hall described Braxton choking her, punching her, throwing things at her, and verbally assaulting her. Even the judge who sentenced her <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">said</a> that during her testimony, Hall seemed to fear her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Hall is one of 28 mothers in 11 states who a recent <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/how-the-law-turns-battered-women-into-criminals#1u8oxdk\">BuzzFeed News investigation</a> found were sentenced to 10 years or more for failing to protect their children. In <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">every one</a> of these cases, there was evidence the mother herself had been violently abused by the man. Hall is one of three cases BuzzFeed News found in which the mother got <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">a longer sentence</a> than the man who actually abused the child.</p>\n<p>Braxton walked free eight years ago, having been <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">let go for time served</a>. Meanwhile, Hall has been locked up in an all-female prison in McLoud, Oklahoma. She said that she has seen her children only once since she went to prison but that they write each other monthly. In letters shared with BuzzFeed News, the children tell her about sports, school, and clothes. They make reference to her case, too. ‚ÄúI hope God Let‚Äôs [sic] you out of jail,‚Äù one letter says.</p>\n<p>Hall has been trying to get her sentence reduced. She currently has <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=542749&amp;offender_book_id=323174\">20 years left</a> behind bars. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed but lost</a>, and the trial judge in her case has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied a request</a> to modify her sentence. She will not be eligible for parole until 2030.</p>\n<p>But she is pursuing one last hope: clemency. Earlier this month, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html\">applied</a> for her sentence to be commuted ‚Äî which would release her while not absolving her of her crime.</p>\n<p>In the wake of BuzzFeed News‚Äô original investigation, a women‚Äôs rights organization <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/meet-the-abuse-victim-who-got-30-years-in-prison-and-the-fem\">took up Hall‚Äôs cause</a>, creating an <a href=\"http://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/tondalo_hall/?source=uv_website\">online petition</a> to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. ‚ÄúTondalo Hall shouldn‚Äôt be in prison while the man who abused her and her children is free,‚Äù wrote <a href=\"http://www.weareultraviolet.org/\">UltraViolet</a>, a group that claims nearly 600,000 members nationwide. On Tuesday, an UltraViolet official said that more than 44,000 people had signed the petition since it was first circulated on Nov. 6.</p>\n<p>In Oklahoma, a pardon or commutation cannot be granted without the approval of the state‚Äôs parole board. It is unclear when the parole board will make a decision on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n<p>Hall herself almost missed the deadline to apply for a commutation. In Oklahoma, only inmates with 20 or more years left on their sentences can apply. When she mailed her application, Hall had 20 years and five days left behind bars.</p>\n<p>Another Oklahoma mother, Alishia Mackey, also received a longer sentence than the abuser, and the victim, her son, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">believes she should be free</a>. But Mackey has 10 years left on <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=489054&amp;offender_book_id=286204\">her sentence</a>, so she is ineligible for a commutation.</p>\n<p>The parole board declined to comment on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231377\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"438\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 390px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall, Oklahoma Department of Corrections</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Some prosecutors defend the long sentences given to battered women who don‚Äôt intervene to stop their children from being harmed as sending a message that mothers have a duty to protect their children, even if they must risk their own safety. But many domestic violence advocates women counter that such punishments blame the victim and demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of what it means for women to be trapped in abusive relationships. Such women often fear alerting authorities because doing so can provoke their partners to extreme violence and because the authorities often fail to protect battered women and their children.</p>\n<p>Hall, who dropped out of high school in 10th grade, told BuzzFeed News that she met Braxton in either 2000 or 2001, when she would have been between 15 and 17. They soon began dating, and Braxton, who is two years older than Hall, seemed ambitious and nice ‚Äî in the beginning.</p>\n<p>She can‚Äôt quite remember what it was that set him off the first time: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell him where I went, or something,‚Äù she recalled. They got into an argument, she said, and he punched her in the face.</p>\n<p>He apologized, she recalled, and said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, and it didn‚Äôt, for a while at least. But then, during another argument, this time when she was pregnant, he put his hands around her throat. ‚ÄúHe told me that my mouth was too smart,‚Äù she would later <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p55/a186122\">testify in court</a>. With her head on the seat of the blue couch in her apartment, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">he choked her</a>.</p>\n<p>The abuse, both physical and verbal, picked up once her third child (and second with Braxton) was born in August 2004, Hall told BuzzFeed News. He isolated her from her loved ones, driving ‚Äúa wedge between me and my family,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">summed up</a> the alleged abuse in her commutation application: ‚ÄúRobert regularly choked me, blackened my eyes, threw objects at me and verbally assaulted me, while my children were in the home.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Hall‚Äôs friend Gayla Watts-Sparger noticed changes in Hall and her children. Watts-Sparger has known Hall since kindergarten and said Hall was always goofy and outgoing. ‚ÄúYou know how you meet somebody, and everything they say is funny?‚Äù Watts-Sparger said.</p>\n<p>But after Hall moved in with Braxton, Hall became ‚Äúa lot quieter,‚Äù Watts-Sparger said, and Hall‚Äôs children acted strange too. Watts-Sparger recalled seeing Hall‚Äôs son, who was maybe a year old at the time, sitting upright and very still for a young child. When Braxton came by, Watts-Sparger said, the young boy would flinch.</p>\n<p>Reached through his Facebook account, Braxton at first said he would speak with BuzzFeed News but then did not respond to subsequent messages. After BuzzFeed News left repeated voicemails and sent a detailed letter to Braxton‚Äôs address given in court papers, a woman identifying herself as ‚ÄúMs. Braxton‚Äù called and said that Robert Braxton does not live there and that she doesn‚Äôt know where he is.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2004, Hall said, she noticed that her 20-month-old son‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p45/a186123\">leg was swollen</a>. Braxton told her he didn‚Äôt know what might have happened. The problem persisted for several days, so she brought the boy to the hospital.</p>\n<p>Doctors determined <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186124\">he had</a> a fractured femur and other broken bones. Suspecting child abuse, authorities checked on Hall and Braxton‚Äôs 3-month-old daughter, and found similar injuries. Both Hall and Braxton were arrested.</p>\n<p>Detectives at the Oklahoma City Police Department brought them both into the same interview room. Before the interrogation, Braxton <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p77/a186125\">was heard whispering to Hall</a>, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">initially told</a> the police that she had hurt their son by throwing him on the bed as they were playing ‚Äî a version she later said was a lie. After Braxton admitted he had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355439-braxton-tells-detective-that-he-squeezed-his.html#document/p1/a186129\">squeezed his baby daughter too tightly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186128\">cranked her leg</a>, detectives <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186476\">concluded</a> that he was the one who had injured both children, not her.</p>\n<p>Hall remained in jail, though. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p17/a186108\">pled guilty</a> to enabling child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. She agreed to testify against Braxton ‚Äî though she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">did not receive a deal</a> from prosecutors for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p>Braxton took his case to trial. Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186131\">wrote</a> in her commutation application that Braxton ‚Äúrepeatedly threatened me‚Äù during their initial court hearings. ‚ÄúFor example, when Robert and I were being shuttled to and from court he would terrorize me. He would tell me that I would spend the rest of my life in prison and he would be out with our children.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Still, Hall agreed to testify against him. During Braxton‚Äôs trial, she was the main witness who could have seen Braxton actually harming the children. Yet Hall could not point to any specific abuse that she witnessed ‚Äî because, she told BuzzFeed News, she didn‚Äôt actually see any abuse happen. In court, she also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p46/a186139\">couldn‚Äôt recall</a> the date her son began having trouble walking.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Angela Marsee grew frustrated that Hall was not providing enough testimony to nail Braxton. ‚ÄúWhat do you know?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186136\">she asked</a>.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186140\">replied</a> that she had once woken up to hear that her daughter was screaming. Braxton had been changing the girl‚Äôs diaper. He told her nothing was wrong and that she should go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">asked for more</a>. ‚ÄúWas there anything else that happened in your apartment that gave you reason to know that your children were in danger at the hands of this defendant?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Hall replied. That‚Äôs when she began to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">describe</a> the time that Braxton had choked her, when she was pregnant. Yet Braxton‚Äôs lawyer <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p57/a186142\">objected</a> to this line of questioning, saying it was not relevant to the child abuse charge against him. The judge sided with Braxton.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186144\">wanted</a> life in prison for Braxton, sensed that their case against him <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">was crumbling</a>. With the trial in recess, the state and the defense worked out a deal. Braxton pled guilty but <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p11/a186106\">admitted</a> to having harmed only one child. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303337-ok-robert-braxton-plea-statement-of-facts.html#document/p1/a178180\">said</a> he grew frustrated while changing his daughter‚Äôs diaper and then broke her bones by ‚Äúusing too much force and pressure for a baby.‚Äù He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p10/a186433\">sentenced</a> to 10 years in prison ‚Äî but eight of those years were suspended, and he was released for time served.</p>\n<p>Hall was upset with the verdict. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like there was any justice for my kids,‚Äù she told BuzzFeed News.</p>\n<p>Someone else was also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">upset</a> with the trial‚Äôs outcome: Marsee, the prosecutor. And she would lay much of the blame on Hall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231006\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 432px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231006','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/11/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-24214-1415725003-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>While Hall remained in jail waiting for the court to decide her punishment, the county probation office conducted <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html\">a pre-sentence report</a>. Investigators interviewed Hall, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">declared</a> that Braxton had been abusive. They also interviewed Hall‚Äôs cousin, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186148\">took custody of her three children</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">According to the report</a>, the cousin stated that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186157\">was a good mother</a> but that Braxton was very controlling, kept Hall away from her family, and did not want the boys to be kissed or hugged because doing so would make them a ‚Äúpunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The report noted that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186151\">was</a> 22 years old, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186149\">had no prior arrests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186150\">suffered</a> from depression. The report recommended a ‚Äúsplit sentence,‚Äù which means some time in prison and some on probation. If released to probation, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186152\">the officers said</a>, ‚ÄúShe would be supervised as a low-level offender.‚Äù Marsee, the prosecutor in both the Braxton and Hall cases, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p22/a186109\">said in court</a> that she had no issues with any of the facts in the report.</p>\n<p>Hall‚Äôs sentencing hearing began <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p20\">on Dec. 20, 2006</a>, two weeks <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p13/a186153\">after</a> Braxton was released. Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p26/a186143\">called</a> for Hall to spend ‚Äúa significant portion of the rest of her life‚Äù in prison. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs their mother,‚Äù Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p27/a186154\">told the court</a>. ‚ÄúShe is the one person in this world who should be standing up for them,‚Äù she said, yet ‚Äúthey were in pain because of what she didn‚Äôt do, and she should pay for that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Marsee also had another reason for recommending a long sentence: Hall, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">she declared</a>, was part of the reason the case against Braxton ‚Äúfell apart.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe definitely should have received a more significant sentence,‚Äù Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">told the court</a>, ‚Äúbut because of her minimizing and continuing to protect herself and protect him, that had a real impact on what we were able to do with him in the jury trial. So she should not benefit from that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In response, Hall‚Äôs attorney Bill Smith pointed to the choking incident. ‚ÄúShe was scared of Robert Braxton,‚Äù Smith <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186112\">told the court</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p28/a186155\">asked</a> that she receive the same sentence as Braxton.</p>\n<p>When it came time for Judge Ray Elliott to announce his decision, he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">told the courtroom</a> that he had noticed some things about Hall‚Äôs testimony. After certain questions, Hall would ‚Äúmake direct eye contact‚Äù with Braxton before ‚Äútaking a moment or two to respond.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat tells me something, based on my years of experience,‚Äù Elliott said. But this did not excuse her. ‚ÄúWas she scared of him? Probably,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, again, even weighing that factor into the equation I‚Äôm of the opinion she was less than candid.‚Äù He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">sentenced her</a> to 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was speechless,‚Äù said Hall‚Äôs friend, Watts-Sparger, when she heard the news. ‚ÄúAll I could do was cry.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed</a> her sentence to a three-judge panel and lost, though a dissenting judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html#document/p5/a186127\">declared</a> that she was a ‚Äúpoor, pathetic young woman with three young children who was involved in an abusive relationship.‚Äù She filed another petition that asked Elliott, the trial judge, to modify her sentence<b>.</b> He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied it</a>, because too much time had elapsed so he no longer had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Elliott told BuzzFeed News that he didn‚Äôt have any recollection of the details of the case ‚Äî it was too long ago for him to remember. Still, he said, ‚ÄúI feel very comfortable with my decision, because I take every decision seriously.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Smith, Hall‚Äôs attorney, also said he couldn‚Äôt remember the specifics of the case. Marsee, the prosecutor, told BuzzFeed News that she, like Hall, felt that Braxton‚Äôs prison term was far too short. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to tell you how frustrated I was with that whole situation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfortunate.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But the fact that she was scared does not absolve her of her duty as a mother. ‚ÄúHer sentence is appropriate for what she allowed him to do to her children,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey lived in pain because of what she did not stop.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231518\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"470\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 422px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231518','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now Hall awaits the result of her commutation request.</p>\n<p>The author of the law under which Hall was convicted serves as the interim executive director of the parole board. Jari Askins was an Oklahoma state representative in 2000 when she wrote a bill that created the crime of ‚Äúenabling child abuse,‚Äù with the word ‚Äúenabling‚Äù meant to drive home that a failure to act was enough to warrant prosecution.</p>\n<p>Her law makes Oklahoma one of at least 29 states that explicitly criminalize parents‚Äô failure to protect their children from abuse. Prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws, such as ones against placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>Askins, whose long career in public service includes stints as a judge and lieutenant governor, told BuzzFeed News that she is sensitive to the plight of battered women. When her law was being considered, she said, she and her fellow legislators didn‚Äôt contemplate that it might help imprison women who themselves had been victimized by their partners. As executive director, she does not vote on clemency requests. Speaking generally, not of Hall‚Äôs case, she said that being battered is a mitigating circumstance that defendants could raise at trial.</p>\n<p>In her application for clemency, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186434\">wrote</a> that the opposite happened. ‚ÄúI believe that my testimony detailing the violence in our home was used against me,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúRather than being protected by the State, I was prosecuted.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p10/a186435\">expressed remorse</a> for not getting her children out of the home sooner: ‚ÄúI had a duty to protect my children and I failed.‚Äù But, she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186156\">wrote</a>, ‚ÄúI was trapped in an abusive relationship and I feared that alerting authorities would provoke Robert to increase his violence.‚Äù She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">said</a> she also feared that Braxton would gain custody of her children. ‚ÄúMy decisions, although detrimental to my family, were made out of fear rather than rationality.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Since she got to prison, Hall has completed her GED and taken parenting classes. She holds down a job in the laundry department. And she writes letters to her children, the youngest of whom is now 10. They write her back maybe once a month or so, she said, telling her how they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre up to.</p>\n<p>The letters update Hall on how grades are going, when spring break is approaching, what the word perimeter means. The children talk about riding bikes and what presents Santa might bring. Some feature drawings. One has two stick figures, with the person on the left labeled ‚Äúme‚Äù and the person on the right labeled ‚Äúyou.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One letter tells Hall that about some new shoes and a favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. It also asks her a question:</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy did my Father break my leg, and ribs? I love you.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231654\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"677\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 629px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231654','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Email the reporter at alex.campbell@buzzfeed.com</i></p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 12:07:13.192137"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-7653-1415738459-12.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-12"], ["title", "This Battered Woman Wants To Get Out Of¬†Prison"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 12:07:13.192137"]]

Fox as they attempted to manage the publicity of the bumbling New York City mayor.</p>\n<p>The character on <i>Spin City</i> has Britton‚Äôs face, but the rest is nearly unrecognizable: Her hair is shorter, browner, and cut in the choppy layers that anyone familiar with the ‚Äò90s will recognize as ‚ÄúThe Rachel.‚Äù Nikki is a classic man-eater: She alludes to threesomes, she towers her co-stars, she‚Äôs coarse and vulgar when the rest of the women in the office come off as sweet or clueless.

Tami Taylor ‚Äî she of the ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù and the hair and the aviators, of the soft exterior and steely drive, of infinite wisdom and ageless beauty. No matter that <i>Friday Night Lights</i> was one of the lowest rated and most beleaguered network shows in recent memory: Through the magic cultural catch-up tool that is Netflix, Taylor has taken on the sort of iconic importance usually reserved for massive Hollywood stars‚Äô roles. If <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and its brand of thoughtful, empathetic, addictive drama has morphed into a quasi-religion, then Tami Taylor is its patron saint, the complicated embodiment of all that made the show feel different and real and smart.</p>\n<p>The character of Tami Taylor lived for 76 episodes and five seasons ‚Äî long enough for her character to subsume the actress who played her. Even in her subsequent starring roles in <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>Nashville</i> feel like she‚Äôs just following a different path on the Tami Taylor Choose Your Adventure novel: In one, her marriage falls apart and she ends up having sex with a man in a rubber suit; in another, she becomes a famous country singer with a complicated love life. But the center ‚Äî the Tami Taylor-ified charisma, the waterfall of hair, and the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about you, do we need to have a talk‚Äù face ‚Äî remains.</p>\n<p>The fortitude and consistency of that center has fostered an adult cult of Connie Britton: a mass of women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 45, who view Britton not just with affection, or awe, but admiration. Every star has fans, but select few have cults. We often associate the word ‚Äúcult‚Äù with mindless, manipulated masses, but the word also connotes a group whose beliefs are in some way deviant or different. If Britton had become a star during those <i>Spin City</i> years, there‚Äôd be nothing cultish about loving her: Like so many other sitcom stars, she was somewhere around 30, thin, white, beautiful, straight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212612\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:description=\"Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:17\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:17\" rel:count=\"2\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal. She‚Äôs still thin, white, beautiful, and straight, but she‚Äôs the thing that the vast majority of mainstream media pretends doesn‚Äôt exist: a woman over 40. More specifically, a woman over 40 whose image combines the sexual <i>and</i> the maternal, the ambitious <i>and</i> the empathetic. As one fan of the hundreds who, when solicited, offered testimonials about why they loved Britton told me, ‚ÄúShe makes getting older seem incredibly appealing ‚Äî not just because she looks stunning, but it‚Äôs the sense of presence and surety she projects.‚Äù The combination of confidence and beauty, of wisdom and maturity ‚Äî that‚Äôs what undergirds her fandom.</p>\n<p>At this moment, the seeming singularity of Connie Britton, and the magnitude of the affection directed toward her, bespeaks a generalized hunger for a female star that models a nuanced, mature, and periodically imperfect form of femininity. It‚Äôs about the hair, of course ‚Äî which has taken on a near totemic function ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also about much more than that.</p>\n<p>Britton is by no means the biggest star in Hollywood: <i>Nashville</i> is limping through its third season, and she was on screen for all of 10 minutes in her most recent film, <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>. But if you look closely, she might be one of the most important. Hollywood didn‚Äôt make Connie Britton a star, cobbling together the most reductive and regressive notions of what it means to be a woman today.

She grew up fairly WASP-y in Maryland and Virginia, went to Dartmouth, majored in Asian Studies, studied abroad with (now Sen.) Kirsten Gillibrand. She‚Äôd been involved in theater in high school and, after graduating from college, moved to New York and married her college boyfriend, and while he became a finance banker, she dabbled in off-off-Broadway productions while taking part-time jobs to help pay the bills, including one as an aerobics instructor, leg warmers and all. (Britton declined to be interviewed for this story.)</p>\n<p>Britton and the finance husband divorced in 1995, but at that point she had spent eight months shooting the film that would put her, however briefly, on the map as the frustrated wife of an adulterous man in Ed Burns‚Äô debut feature, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, a small character study with a tiny budget that went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.</p>\n<p><i>McMullen</i> didn‚Äôt make Britton a household name, but it did put her on casting directors‚Äô radar, which is how she nearly won the <i>Jerry Maguire</i> role that eventually went to Renee Zellweger.</p>\n<p>Two paths diverged in a Hollywood casting room: One star (Zellweger) became a household name, while the other went on to a string of sitcoms. The <i>Maguire</i> role would have made Britton into a late-‚Äò90s It Girl, but one look at the current state of Zellweger‚Äôs career ‚Äî and the current uproar over daring to age and/or her resistance to it ‚Äî and you can see why Britton should be thankful to have missed the chance to make out with Tom Cruise.</p>\n<p>Instead of <i>Maguire</i>, Britton found herself cast in a slew of doomed pilots and in a multi-episode stint on the original <i>Ellen</i> as the overbearing, clueless sister of one of Ellen‚Äôs best friends, and eventually landed the role of Nikki on <i>Spin City</i>, where she would win the sort of quiet following that often follows supporting sitcom characters.</p>\n<p>But when Fox‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs disease forced him to leave <i>Spin City</i> in 2000, Britton‚Äôs character was written off the show. For the next six years, she jumped from one small role to the next, sometimes picking up a recurring gig, as she did in <i>The West Wing</i>, other times ending up a piece of ‚Äò80s-costumed window dressing, as she did in the film adaptation of Buzz Bissinger‚Äôs <i>Friday Night Lights</i> in 2004. It was an exhausting, frustrating schlep between sets and roles and disappointments.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Peter Berg, who had produced the film version of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, was working on a television adaptation for NBC that would be far more loosely based on the real-life events collected in Bissinger‚Äôs book. He asked Britton to reprise the same role she had played in the film, promising that this time, her role would be more fleshed out. ‚ÄúI was really, really hesitant,‚Äù Britton told <i>Variety.</i> ‚ÄúIn fact, I said, ‚ÄòNo. I love you and adore you, but I don‚Äôt want to.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet Berg reiterated his promise for something bigger and meatier than a meekly supportive coach‚Äôs wife ‚Äî and it was that role, as guidance counselor, mother, wife, and eventually principal, that would, over the course of five seasons, turn Connie Britton into the household name that she nearly became more than a decade before. She wasn‚Äôt a buxom young starlet or the hottest new thing; she was just, quite simply and clearly, one of television‚Äôs best actresses in one of its most complicated roles.</p>\n<p>The details of Britton‚Äôs struggle ultimately matter less than the sheer fact of a woman breaking through in Hollywood at the age of 39. But that‚Äôs just one of the qualities of Britton‚Äôs image that have made it so pervasively popular over the last eight years. For men and women alike, she exudes what feels like an amorphous, complex feminine aura. But ask any woman to tease that apart and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs an amalgamation of several interlocking areas: softness, maturity, progressiveness, and a particular take on ‚Äúhaving it all.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212371\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 852px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212371','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Loccisano / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù isn‚Äôt to do with Britton‚Äôs body ‚Äî which is pilates-toned, but by no means a size zero ‚Äî so much as her demeanor. And the way we understand Britton‚Äôs demeanor is as an extension of Tami Taylor, who spent five seasons negotiating her way to power from the stereotypically subservient position of ‚Äúcoach‚Äôs wife‚Äù in a football-obsessed town.</p>\n<p>Instead of forcefully critiquing the cultural infrastructure from the outside, she works within its existing boundaries to change it. Her beauty, her smile, that nice-lady voice, all of it is a way of getting what she/the high school students she counsels want or need, especially when dealing with apparatuses of power (the boosters, the school board, Joe McCoy). She kills not with kindness, but with <a href=\"http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihYkEAQ_DY\">y‚Äôalls</a>.</p>\n<p>Tami‚Äôs power is negotiated, but it‚Äôs also a realistic rendering of how women in much of America are able to fight and win battles on a daily basis. Instead of busting balls, attempting to engage in conversation. Instead of insulting another‚Äôs way of life, trying to inhabit it. Tami‚Äôs mix of the soft Southern exterior with steely drive emulates a form of activism wholly recognizable to anyone who‚Äôs attempted to effect change in an environment wholly resistant to it.</p>\n<p>That Tami Taylor brand of softness is replicated in Britton‚Äôs off-screen persona. No matter that Britton isn‚Äôt exactly a native Southerner: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conniebritton\">Her Twitter account</a> is littered with y‚Äôalls. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that Britton is performing ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù; rather, it‚Äôs become a naturally accentuated component of her public persona. It‚Äôs amplified every time an interviewer asks her to recreate the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of Tami Taylor ‚Äî getting her to don Taylor‚Äôs signature aviators, for example ‚Äî and underlined in her leading role in <i>Nashville</i>, in which she might say fewer ‚Äúy‚Äôalls‚Äù but still embraces the same model of conciliatory power and strength, this time with more glitter and halter tops. The softness ‚Äî and its power to persuade ‚Äî endures. And of course, on screen and off, with its soft waves, its welcoming caramel color, there‚Äôs the hair.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Britton, the first thing they talk about is the hair. Even in professional interviews, journalists ask her about it. Seth Meyers pegged <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj7nBKUXg8\">an entire segment</a> to it. The Britton cover story in <i>More</i> magazine begins with, ‚ÄúThe hair is tawny, thick, and tousled to casual perfection. And it‚Äôs all her own.‚Äù <i>American Horror Story</i> showrunner Ryan Murphy says, ‚ÄúShe has the best hair in Hollywood.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs the hair-supported <a href=\"about:blank\">Tumblr</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConBritsHair\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/magazine/video/how-to-connie-britton-waves\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/connie-britton-hair-how-to-tutorial-hairstyle-I535890\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvt3QU7Z-8k\">tutorials</a>.</p>\n<p>The hair connotes softness, but it also suggests a sort of unfettered, unabashed womanliness. It‚Äôs not just the volume ‚Äî although that‚Äôs part of it ‚Äî or the beautiful color. It‚Äôs not even the hair itself so much as what it‚Äôs not: namely, the stereotypical haircut of a fortysomething mother, doomed to the next four decades of practical mom-cuts.</p>\n<p>As cultural critics Sarah Blackwood and Sarah Mesle <a href=\"http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2012/10/16/on-connie-brittons-hair/\">put it</a>, ‚ÄúThe Hair asks us to think about a heavy ponytail at 40. Let‚Äôs not dismiss this as a joke, or as the same question as Botox or artificially plumped lips. If Botox is always about youth obsession, Connie Britton‚Äôs Hair is not always ‚Äî or even ever ‚Äî an attempt to look like Lyla Garrity or Hayden Panettiere. It might actually be about the specific pleasure of forty-ness.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The utter fullness of the hair is like a testament to a life well-lived. The strawberry blonde highlights suggest a life spent in the sun; its ability to swing in a ponytail, to rope up in a French twist, tousle around the shoulders, even to look just this side of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jbf%20hair\">J.B.F</a>., is like an extension of all the modes of femininity occupied by today‚Äôs accomplished woman.</p>\n<p>Britton‚Äôs hair refuses to hew the line of what a woman‚Äôs hair (or life) should resemble. It‚Äôs not unruly the way that, say, Helena Bonham Carter‚Äôs hair is ‚Äî but it declares, through its sheer existence, a different self-conception for a woman over 40 than those proffered by the media. The hair, in other words, feels like a revelation.</p>\n<p>But if we‚Äôre talking about Connie Britton‚Äôs hair, we‚Äôre also talking about the way it complements her face. Usually people say that a face ‚Äúbetrays‚Äù one‚Äôs age, but Britton‚Äôs face functions as the opposite of betrayal: Each smile line and crow‚Äôs-foot makes her somehow more, not <i>less</i>, beautiful. She‚Äôs not old; she‚Äôs <i>mature</i>. And with that maturity comes a certain wisdom: the ability, for example, to discuss big, often alienating issues with grace and empathy, whether it‚Äôs talking to her teenage daughter about losing her virginity (<i>Friday Night Lights</i>) or figuring out how to admit that her marriage is over (<i>Nashville</i>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212609\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:description=\"Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3505101_4212609\" rel:via=\"annehelen\" rel:sub_title=\"Usually%20male%20stars%20are%20the%20ones%20who%20grow%20into%20their%20looks%20‚Äî\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:16\" rel:count=\"5\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs no coincidence that Britton worked in Hollywood for decades before breaking through. She was always beautiful, but it wasn‚Äôt until she looked the way she does now that beauty became one of her defining adjectives. Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant ‚Äî but most female stars peak and often became hyperreal versions of their former selves, an amalgam of precise surgery and injections.</p>\n<p>In this way, Britton‚Äôs refusal to transform her face becomes an act of rebellion against a system of norms that would rather she freeze all movement above her eyebrows than have a visible wrinkle. But Britton has also consciously refused to bend her narrative into that of a woman obsessed with her own aging. As she told <i>Esquire</i>, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really focused on myself as a quote-unquote ‚Äòwoman maturing.‚Äô I try to avoid that at all costs. ‚Ä¶ Some of the press that happened around <i>Nashville</i> really was an eye-opener for me, because there were a lot of initial stories describing my character as ‚Äòaging‚Äô and ‚Äòover the hill,‚Äô and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck?‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Originally, Britton‚Äôs <i>Nashville</i> character was framed as the aging has-been to Hayden Panettiere‚Äôs Taylor Swift-esque ingenue, but Britton hated the dichotomy. She fought the writers to cut scenes, like one planned for the premiere, in which she did the stereotypical pull-at-your-face-and-look-sad routine. She was ‚Äúfurious‚Äù about the trajectory of her character, especially, as Britton explained, given what had recently happened in her own career: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even who I represent as an actor,‚Äù she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <i>New York Times.</i> ‚ÄúMy life started being awesome five years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>To admit that life can, indeed, start to be awesome at 40 ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great quote. But it also exemplifies the sort of ideological rebellion that crystallizes the cult around her.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212435\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212435','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jonathan Leibson / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, we never know how Eric and Tami Taylor vote. We can safely assume that the rest of their small Texas town almost certainly votes Republican, but the narrative never hinges on questions of political affinity. Rather, it divides on lines of haves and have-nots, of who advocates for which side and with what motivation. Tami Taylor might not label herself a liberal, but she‚Äôs an unequivocal progressive, working on the micro scale to rectify macro-level divisions of class, race, and gender.</p>\n<p>The most prominent example manifests in the form of Taylor‚Äôs counsel to Becky, a 16-year-old who becomes pregnant the first time she has sex. When Becky asks Tami how she‚Äôd advise her own daughter in the same situation, Tami‚Äôs response is a master class in ethical counsel: ‚ÄúI would tell her to think about her life, think about what‚Äôs important to her and what she wants, and I would tell her that she‚Äôs in a real tough spot, and then I would support whatever decision she made.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The episode received a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/arts/television/10lights.html\">significant</a> <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2010/07/12/friday-night-lights-takes-on-abortion/\">amount</a> <a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2010/02/04/friday-night-lights-abortion-plotline-mustsee-tv/\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/07/friday-night-lights-tackles-abortion/59495/\">attention</a>, in part because it was the first to directly address abortion on broadcast television since, well, <i>Maude,</i> nearly three decades before. But it‚Äôs but one of dozens of ways in which Taylor‚Äôs character models a progressive social view: the way she advocates for, and achieves, an equal partnership with her husband; her handling of the revelation of the mayor‚Äôs lesbianism; the best sex talk in television history; her overarching and persistent advocacy for Tyra in all parts of her life. You could say that Tami‚Äôs just doing her job as a guidance counselor, but she‚Äôs doing her job in a deeply humanistic way that‚Äôs implicitly, if not explicitly, in line with the aims of social justice.</p>\n<p>Tami is outspoken and candid, never didactic or preachy. It‚Äôs the way, really, so many of us imagine our best activist selves: not as actors in some hyperpoliticized arena, but as good people helping and doing and advising not because of some overarching ideology, but because it seems right.</p>\n<p>If Tami Taylor is the primary narrative agent of social justice in <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, then it makes sense that the aura of progressivism clings to Britton‚Äôs image outside of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>. But Britton‚Äôs own actions have only strengthened the conflation of Taylor‚Äôs work with her ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù beliefs. When the Mitt Romney campaign started using the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> catchphrase ‚ÄúClear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can‚Äôt Lose,‚Äù Britton shot back, penning an <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/28/women-birth-control-friday-night-lights/1663895/\">editorial</a> for <i>USA Today</i> arguing that Romney‚Äôs stance on birth control was counter to the central tenets of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i> During Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis‚Äô filibuster to block a restrictive antiabortion bill, Britton not only proclaimed her support, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/connie-britton-lisa-edelstein-support-578118\">but released a limited-edition T-shirt</a> inscribed with ‚ÄúWhat Would Tami Taylor Do?‚Äù (<a href=\"http://standwithtexaswomen.org\">standwithtexaswomen.org</a> on the back) with all proceeds directed to Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Britton, like Taylor ‚Äî and like the stated doctrine of Planned Parenthood ‚Äî is not advocating for abortion, but for <i>choice</i>. But even that sort of advocacy would be too much of a polarizing issue for most celebrities to touch. It‚Äôs OK to support a political candidate, but a divisive issue like abortion, that‚Äôs something else entirely.</p>\n<p>But if Britton‚Äôs willingness to attach herself to the issue of reproductive rights might have alienated a minority of fans, it served to fortify the support of the majority and solidify the cult. Even as it‚Äôs become increasingly accepted for celebrities to identify as feminists, few speak specifically about what that means, in action ‚Äî in part, of course, to avoid losing fans or potential projects. Britton‚Äôs vocal support of feminist candidates and causes makes her advocacy seem less strategic, performative, or planned and more of an extension of a ‚Äútrue‚Äù self and belief system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212608\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212608','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Rick Diamond / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a woman to ‚Äúhave it all,‚Äù she must, in some vague, unspecific terms, manage to simultaneously satisfy her boss, her children, and her partner; then, and only then, can she can be satisfied herself.

As one half of what has been called ‚Äú<a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/04/11/greatest-tv-couple-staff-pick-friday-night-lights/\">the greatest TV couple of all time</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/friday-night-lights-finale-how-the-best-marriage-on-tv-was-created/70996/\">the best marriage on television</a>,‚Äù Britton ‚Äî along with co-star Kyle Chandler ‚Äî models a relationship that‚Äôs an actual partnership. It‚Äôs imperfect, it‚Äôs filled with strife, but unlike most television dramas, which pivot on the question of when and how a couple will end up cheating on each other, Britton and Chandler decided that potential infidelity would never be the guiding question of their on-screen relationship.</p>\n<p>Rather, the narrative focuses on how two ambitious, focused individuals do their best to keep loving each other ‚Äî and their daughters ‚Äî and still do the things that make them feel like worthwhile, accomplished humans. It‚Äôs never perfect: The house is never clean, Baby Gracie is often lugged around in confusion, teenage Julie is pissed a lot, and there is a modicum of white wine in every episode, but it feels like a lived-in, loving partnership, something to which a couple can aspire, rather than a way of judging their deficiencies. And the message of the series finale ‚Äî in which Tami tells Eric that it‚Äôs her turn to let her career guide the trajectory of their lives ‚Äî is also the most radical way for a show about a football team to wrap up, ever, the end.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù of <i>FNL</i> is having some of all the things that matter to you, and finding value and validation in doing the best you‚Äôre able at those chosen things. You see the same philosophy modeled in <i>Nashville</i>, in which Britton‚Äôs character manages to juggle a career, two daughters, a collapsing marriage, an alcoholic love-of-her-life, and multiple new suitors, while also serving as a mentor to younger artists and starting her own record label. Rayna James doesn‚Äôt do any of those things perfectly, but she does them ‚Äî and refuses to apologize for that seeming lack of perfection.</p>\n<p>At the heart of both characters is a complexity, and an eagerness to balance a multiplicity of identities, that Britton herself has pushed for. On <i>Friday Nights Lights,</i> her attention to her character‚Äôs trajectory was described as ‚Äúrabid‚Äù; for her turn in <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>, she refused to allow the role of a woman dating a man two decades her junior to degenerate into that of a ‚Äúcougar.‚Äù When <i>Fast Company</i> <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3009149/most-creative-people-2013/13-connie-britton\">named</a> her as No. 13 of the ‚Äú100 Most Creative People In Business,‚Äù she outlined the strategy she‚Äôs adopted for ‚Äúowning‚Äù a character: With each script, she goes through the dialogue line by line, working with <i>Nashville</i> showrunner Callie Khouri to identify ‚Äúlines that don‚Äôt feel right‚Äù for the character of Rayna.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not difficult to understand, then, why so many ambitious women find themselves drawn to Britton and the women she‚Äôs played on screen: As one fan explained to me, ‚ÄúTami and Rayna totally captivate me because they‚Äôre each deeply OK with themselves, and that‚Äôs the source of their power.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That sort of deep ‚ÄúOK-ness‚Äù extends to Britton‚Äôs personal life, in which she‚Äôs balanced a career with the duties of single motherhood (she adopted a son, Yobi, from Ethiopia in 2011), advocacy, and even sex. Friend and producer Sarah Aubrey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told</a> the <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i> magazine that ‚Äúin my experience of watching Connie Britton‚Äôs dating life, it has not been Connie getting beaten out by 25-year-old girls, let‚Äôs leave it at that.‚Äù Or, in Britton‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put it this way: The older you get, the easier it is to date younger men. There are more of them.‚Äù Britton‚Äôs been linked with comedian Jason Mantzoukas, but unlike contemporaries Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz, whose love lives play out in the headlines, framed as fruitless searches for domestic bliss, Britton has kept her love life (and, presumably, really hot younger boyfriends) out of the limelight.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Britton acknowledges how difficult single parenthood is ‚Äî but also how privileged she is to have assistance. ‚ÄúOur hours [as actors] are long,‚Äù Britton <a href=\"http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/connie-britton-interview#slide-1\">told</a> <i>Redbook</i>, ‚Äúbut I would never compare what I do with what anyone else does. Everybody‚Äôs working hard and doing the best they can ‚Äî if you‚Äôre a mom, there‚Äôs that pressure, we all face it. I‚Äôm constantly being pulled in different directions. But that‚Äôs the thing: Moms are pulled and distracted. I would never say it‚Äôs worse for me because I‚Äôm an actor.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That frankness ‚Äî about the challenges of being a mother, but also the privileges and the desire and how to make it work with her life ‚Äî is what not only distinguishes Britton‚Äôs image, but makes it meaningful to so many women.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212647\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Cult of Connie Britton\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/enhanced/webdr12/anigif_enhanced-mid-30924-1415515869-20.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Britton isn‚Äôt a movie star ‚Äî and it seems very unlikely she will become one. There‚Äôs a reason her most memorable roles are on television; why the most indelible vision of her isn‚Äôt on the front of a magazine, but in the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> opening credits, with her hair pulled haphazardly up, in a cotton T-shirt, raising her hands in the air in a dance-like victory. She could be your own mom, or sister, or best friend, proclaiming some small life victory in your own little kitchen after a glass of wine at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>With a liberal arts education and a thoroughly middle-class upbringing, Britton‚Äôs image resonates most with women whose trajectories are similar: On and off <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, she may be advocating for those who don‚Äôt enjoy the same privilege as she does, but the cult of Britton does skew toward those who are educated, middle class, and white. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that this is Britton‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù ‚Äî her race, class, and educational background were in place long before she became a star ‚Äî so much as to underline that Britton resonates with a particular demographic that, uncoincidentally, makes up a significant percentage of people who are sharing things on social media.</p>\n<p>This sort of highly specific popularity is the new normal: Instead of a common group of Hollywood stars and prominent public figures who function as de facto models for everyone, the fragmentation of the American entertainment industry has birthed more, not fewer, idols. The internet has facilitated the elevation of the weird, the unique, and those who speak specifically to groups of people who feel that no other mainstream idol could.</p>\n<p>Stardom scholar Richard Dyer <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Heavenly_Bodies.html?id=oUJ0Qbse7lYC\">claimed</a> that ‚Äústars matter because they act out aspects of life that matter to us; and performers get to be stars when what they act out matters to enough people.‚Äù Connie Britton can‚Äôt be a star, then, because what she acts out ‚Äî the possibility of beauty and vibrancy and sexuality over 40, unabashed advocacy and engaged feminist action ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt yet matter to enough people.</p>\n<p>The adult cult of Connie Britton is vocal and visible, but it‚Äôs still a fringe fandom. But the history of stardom is littered with actors whose importance didn‚Äôt become clear until years after their tenure, especially unruly, feminist ones like Katharine Hepburn, who was famously labeled ‚Äúbox office poison‚Äù in 1939, only to the next four decades slowly turning herself into an icon. But along with stars like Angelina Jolie, who has made it her mission <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/angelina-jolies-perfect-game\">to offer a different blueprint</a> for how to wield power and influence in Hollywood, Britton is fundamentally challenging the polished, safe, postfeminist vision of female stardom that currently dominates so much of the Hollywood landscape. And that‚Äôs something like progress, y‚Äôall.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4207834\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

This year, California has had <a href=\"http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/incidents/incidents_stats?year=2014\">over 5,300 wildfires,</a> which is about 700 more than had occurred by this time in 2013, and a thousand more than the five-year average. Now, as the West is coming to the end of one of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/10/22/358096112/coping-in-a-drier-world-californias-drought-survival-strategy\">driest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-warmest-year-california-heat-20140917-story.html\">hottest</a> years in recorded history, the work of inmate firefighters has become essential to California‚Äôs financial and environmental health.</p>\n<p>Someone called Barr‚Äôs name and directed him into a closet marked Evidence Room, where a guard handed him a black sign and took his photograph from behind a beige console housing an ancient PC. And then there he was on the screen: 6 feet 2 inches and sullen, with a big, soft face and an overgrown goatee.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your CDC number?‚Äù the guard asked him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your date of birth? Where else have you done time? When are you going home?‚Äù</p>\n<p>As long as he didn‚Äôt mess this thing up, didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúrolled up,‚Äù as inmate firefighters call getting sent back to a walled institution, he‚Äôd be released in a little over a year, on Nov. 30, 2014. And he didn‚Äôt want to go back to drug dealing when he did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting close to 40. I don‚Äôt have another one in me,‚Äù he explained to me. It was his second conviction, and a third conviction for sales in California would put him away for life. ‚ÄúEvidently, it‚Äôs not working, so I have to try something else.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the fire camp, the questions continued: ‚ÄúWhile incarcerated have you ever been involved in a sexually related assault? Do you have any gang affiliation? Any other moniker besides your name? Any mental health concerns?‚Äù</p>\n<p>Barr gave the answers they wanted, and the man gave him his new identity on a small plastic card. He understood why they had to ask, even if almost no one told the truth. He knew this place was too dangerous for gangs. Turn against one another, lose trust in your crewmates, and you might not survive the next fire.</p>\n<p>Just as undeniable changes to the climate have made Cal Fire‚Äôs role even more crucial, its dirt-cheap supply of labor is being threatened, as the first trickles of a national movement toward prison reform arrive in California. Fire camps like Holton are supposed to accept only well-behaved inmates with no history of violence, arson, or sex crimes, and so most prisoner firefighters are, like Barr, serving time for low-level offenses, especially drug sales.</p>\n<p>With a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/\">majority</a> of Americans now questioning whether it is humane or economically sound to keep nonviolent drug offenders, who pose little or no threat to public safety, locked up for extended periods, the exact population of trustworthy inmates devoting their incarceration to wildfire protection has started finding its way back onto the streets much sooner. Because if we can trust guys like Barr on the front lines of a fire with a chainsaw or an axe, should they really be locked up for so long in the first place? At a time when a program like this has never been more necessary, its future has never been more in question.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143129\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143129','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>There is nothing new about putting prisoners to work to cover the cost of their stay. As far back as the 12th century, during the reign of King Henry II, Britain‚Äôs private jail operators leased their prisoners out as daily workers to whoever could pay a rate higher than what it cost to give the inmates the food, water, and shelter necessary to survive.</p>\n<p>In the 18th century, most criminals in America were punished with fines, beatings, or death. It was the idealistic Quakers who thought incarceration and labor might be a more compassionate and useful alternative. Whether this held in practice is debatable: Although many in Philadelphia‚Äôs infamous Walnut Street Jail, which opened in the late 1700s, spent their days making handicrafts like wicker chairs to sell, every single prisoner lived in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p>Most of the county jails that began cropping up in the U.S. during the first half of the 19th century made no attempt at reforming or employing inmates. Then in 1867, early muckrakers E.C. Wines and Theodore W. Dwight published a scathing expos√© of American jails that called for prisons to become places that taught people how to become better citizens.</p>\n<p>Soon, all across the nation, those with an eye on rehabilitation and those with an eye on budgets found common ground in giving prisoners something useful and profitable to do. Leasing convicts to private businesses made a tidy fortune for both state and local governments, especially after slaves were emancipated. In 1878, 73% of Alabama‚Äôs entire state revenue came from prison labor. Reconstruction-era plantation owners, though, were hardly incentivized to care about their charges: When any of their starving workers died, they simply asked the state for new ones, at no cost to their bottom line.</p>\n<p>In the early 20th century, the tide of public opinion began to turn on prison labor. It wasn‚Äôt fair to allow such cheap workers in the market, the argument went, because it hurt competition and drove down wages for everybody. Since the late 1930s, prison labor in the United States has, for the most part, only been able to produce goods or provide services for the public sector.</p>\n<p>California‚Äôs fire camps began during World War II, when the state‚Äôs firefighters went off to fight and the inmates who had been tasked with building and maintaining public highways moved in to take their place. When the war ended, the state decided to keep them there. Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, and Utah all have since established fire camps of their own, but even the biggest of those programs is less than half the size of California‚Äôs. Now fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long American tradition of putting our criminals to work for hardly any money, under the auspices of rehabilitating them.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPrison labor has been most successful in areas where the risk of dying or being very seriously injured is pretty high,‚Äù said W. David Ball, an assistant professor in criminal justice at the Santa Clara University School of Law. After all, he says, convicted criminals have lost the right to manage their own lives, to a certain extent; when Congress passed the 13th Amendment in 1865, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude, they made sure to include the following phrase: ‚Äúexcept as a punishment for crime.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143140\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"997\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 949px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúAtta baby!‚Äù Fire Captain Darus Ane shouted, extending his fist for a pound. ‚ÄúNice work, baby! Beautiful!‚Äù</p>\n<p>The approaching inmate wheezed back a ‚ÄúThanks, Cap!‚Äù before slowly lifting his hand from where it had been pushing down on his thigh with each step.</p>\n<p>A few yards downhill, Barr kept his eyes focused on the ground as he approached the ledge where Ane, a smiling Joe Biden look-alike with darker hair and a more genuine tan, was doling out words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaintain! Last 50 to the top!‚Äù Ane called to him. Barr huffed and puffed, shaking his head as he passed, refusing to make eye contact with either me or the captain.</p>\n<p>Barr had been at camp for six weeks, and he was exhausted. He hadn‚Äôt seen a fire yet, but every day he woke up and threw his body into whatever task Ane and the foremen set before him: gathering brush in the forest, clearing debris by the side of the road, pushing through a timed hike like this one.</p>\n<p>If he didn‚Äôt get to the top in time, he would get written up; dawdle up the mountain more than once, and he could get sent back to jail. He and his 15-man fire crew ‚Äî crew two ‚Äî were charging uphill in a steady stream, swerving around rocks and scrub. Some could barely breathe. Others leaped like it was nothing, sweat forming a dark V on the back of their orange jumpsuits.</p>\n<p>Once he settled into the camp routine, when the initial relief of being away from the nightmare of county jail wore off, the severity of this work became apparent. The only possible relief would come from getting more physically fit: ‚ÄúYou just have to train,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Ane has been leading inmate crews for two and a half years, enough time for him to hone a tough but upbeat disposition in the hopes that he can reform his charges. ‚ÄúWe gotta break them down physically to build them up mentally,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe show them that it takes hard work to be successful, and hard work usually pays off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The CDCR and state officials often frame the inmate firefighting program in a similar way, emphasizing the benefits of building discipline through physical labor and helping others.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDoing good things in life can change your whole world for you, because you will be remembered for that something good, instead of the negative,‚Äù former L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca <a href=\"http://www.dailynews.com/20121119/pitchess-detention-center-inmates-graduate-from-fire-training-camp\">told future fire camp inmates</a> at a county jail graduation ceremony in 2012.</p>\n<p>When Barr finally reached the summit, he was relieved to find that time had yet to run out. But just as he caught his breath it was time to pile back into the truck and head to another mountainside. There, crew two would throw on 40-pound packs, goggles, gloves, helmets, and boots, and spend three or four hours practicing what‚Äôs called ‚Äúcutting line,‚Äù the primary contribution that inmates make to the surge of overlapping efforts involved in fighting and containing a wildfire.</p>\n<p>When cutting line, the goal is to carve a path of exposed mineral soil in the earth that will stop the flames, blocking their access to more fuel. The work is difficult, hot, and monotonous. The most senior guys on the crew walk in front with chainsaws, and all they do is saw, saw, saw. Other inmates chop the chaparral with a Pulaski, a tool that is half axe, half adze. As one of the newest guys on the crew, Barr was third from the back with a combination rake and hoe, called a McLeod, bending to scrape the dirt and push grasses out of the way until his back was sore and his body drenched in sweat.</p>\n<p>Paid firefighters cut line too, sometimes, but mostly they drive the bulldozers, they grip the hoses, they scribble strategy on clipboards, and they dump water and bright red retardant from air tankers and helicopters. Pretty much all inmates will do on a fire is head into steep terrain, where bulldozers can‚Äôt reach, and cut line.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTheir value is that force of human power,‚Äù said Janet Upton, the deputy director of communications at Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>As he toiled in the sun for less $2 a day, Barr couldn‚Äôt help but point out what he saw as fire camp‚Äôs unacknowledged historical precedent: slavery. (Prisoner firefighters in California earn that base salary and an additional $1 an hour when they are on a fire.) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not <i>right</i>,‚Äù he told me.</p>\n<p>Barr‚Äôs not the only inmate to make that comparison. A few years ago, when University of Toronto sociologist Philip Goodman was working on his dissertation at University of California ‚Äì Irvine, he spoke to more than 45 prisoner firefighters. Ten used the word ‚Äúslavery‚Äù to describe their experiences, but seven of those ten also used the word ‚Äúrehabilitation.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, back at camp, Barr was free to move about as he pleased: to play Ping-Pong or pinochle, to lift weights, to build a wooden clock with the circle saws in the hobby shop, to catch a movie on one of two big-screen TVs. He could take out as many books as he wanted from the library, rather than just one a week. He could joke around with guys of other races without fear of fights.</p>\n<p>One of the inmate chefs was outside plucking corn, peppers, and tomatoes from the camp garden to put in the salsa for that evening‚Äôs taco night. Two black Labradors roamed the camp off-leash, creating an oddly domestic feeling, even if they were there to sniff for drugs.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than where I was at. I‚Äôll just leave it at that,‚Äù Barr said. ‚ÄúHere, at least, you can come outside.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He mostly hoped to make it through the next 11 months as quickly as possible. He also grew impatient with any talk of how this program could somehow fundamentally change him, as a person, for the better.</p>\n<p>Inmates are often insulted by the state‚Äôs claims to be teaching them how to work. Most come from poverty, where holding down two minimum wage jobs and putting in 70-hour weeks will get you nowhere fast. Many, as people of color, face profound socially and politically condoned opposition in ascending the socioeconomic ladder, regardless of how hard they work.</p>\n<p>Barr only has a high school education, and says selling crack seemed like the most lucrative option available to him. He regrets dropping out of junior college after less than a semester, and he snorts with laughter when he hears that part of the justification for sending him to fight fires is that he must learn how to work hard in order to abandon his criminal ways.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course I knew how to work hard before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was just working hard at something illegal.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143152\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Amanda Chicago Lewis for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Barr shifted in his seat as the Los Angeles County fire truck rumbled along the empty streets of Glendora. The day before, on Jan. 16, three guys in their early twenties had decided to go camping on federal land in Angeles National Forest. ‚ÄúGoing to hunt mountain lions,‚Äù one posted on Facebook, before tagging his two friends. In the morning, the powerful Santa Ana winds blew a piece of paper from their illegal campfire into the brush, igniting the entire hillside. By the time Barr‚Äôs crew rolled in, over 3,600 residents had been evacuated and five homes destroyed due to what was being called the Colby Fire. The blaze had already consumed 1,700 acres since morning.</p>\n<p>Barr had been at fire camp for less than three months. The truck stopped, and the crew began to file off. ‚ÄúThis was the test,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>January is not typically part of what‚Äôs called fire season, when conditions in the western United States are most likely to turn a flicked cigarette butt into a dangerous, expensive nightmare. The Colby Fire was one of over a thousand that came well before the end of spring in 2014, signaling this year would likely bring an unprecedented number of incidents, straining resources across the region.</p>\n<p>But the current drought ‚Äî deemed ‚Äú<a href=\"http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA\">exceptional</a>‚Äù in July by the federal government ‚Äî is not an anomaly, a problem that will go away next year. It‚Äôs more like a warning shot, signaling a permanent shift in the moisture level of the soil, the brush and the timber. Although most firefighting personnel will hem and haw about why, exactly, the climate is changing, afraid to take what‚Äôs seen as a political stance on global warming, they all acknowledge that conditions are getting progressively worse. That means that in the coming years, Cal Fire will need to hire more firefighters and find money to pay for more frequent and intense blazes. Already, the coffers are in trouble.</p>\n<p>When Barr got to the Colby Fire, as soon as he started to work, adrenaline flooded his senses, bringing his attention to the task at hand. ‚ÄúThat anxiety went away. It was just something regular. It kicked in, my training.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For 12 hours, from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., he swept the ground with his McLeod, over and over, until the brown dirt turned to silt. They walked and walked, until they were inches from the flames. And a few times, as they strode at a rapid pace across inclines so precipitous they approached the vertical, he slipped and fell, but he always stood back up again, following the foreman, doing whatever was asked of him.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe foremen I have, they know what they‚Äôre doing. I know they wouldn‚Äôt put me in a dangerous situation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes they have their days, probably had a bad day with the wife and kids, but other than that they treat us like, you know, like we‚Äôre one of them, basically, pretty much.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Finally, with the first glows of twilight, they headed back to Holton to get some rest before the next shift. When he got to camp, at dawn, Barr heard that some of the guys on another crew had screamed when they first got to the fire.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLike little girls,‚Äù he told me later. ‚ÄúNot crew two! We know what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of Jan. 17, when Barr returned to the fire for his second day, he could hardly feel the cuts and bruises from where he‚Äôd fallen the night before. Driving in, he saw the residents applauding them as they passed.</p>\n<p>His crew worked the fire for a week, and by the end he had developed a new respect for the firemen who took custody of him during the day, for their expertise and for the seriousness of their mission.</p>\n<p>Usually, inmate firefighters lack the cocksure gait that characterizes paid firefighters. But after his first fire, Barr began to walk with quiet purpose. He stopped muttering, started making eye contact with more people, and seemed to relax a bit.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou know, maybe it wasn‚Äôt bad, coming here,‚Äù Barr said a few weeks later. ‚ÄúYou feel like you‚Äôre doing something, other than just sitting in jail. You feel like you‚Äôve accomplished something.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143539\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143539','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"This year, California has had over 5,300 wildfires, about 700 more than by this time in 2013.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20324-1414695088-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Under strict sentencing guidelines issued in the 1970s, ‚Äô80s, and ‚Äô90s, nonviolent drug offenders like Barr have been clogging state and federal prisons for years, with no <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/ideas/publications/reports/pdf/lse-ideas-drugs-report-final-web.pdf\">discernible</a> decrease in the number of Americans using or selling drugs. But in this era of deficit reduction and belt-tightening that began with the Great Recession, the <a href=\"http://famm.org/the-facts-with-sources/#7\">public</a> has largely finally grown weary of the expensive fact that United States has 5% of the world‚Äôs population but 25% of the world‚Äôs prisoners. Attorney General Eric Holder <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/holder-mandatory-minimums/\">announced</a> last August that the federal government would no longer pursue such long sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, inspired by reform in states like Texas, Rhode Island, and New York.</p>\n<p>California‚Äôs drug-offender sentencing policy remains among the strictest in the country. As a result, California‚Äôs prisons have <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/07/convicting-california\">long suffered</a> the natural consequences of overcrowding, including delayed medical treatment and inhumane conditions. In 2011, after a protracted legal battle, the Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24scotus.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">ordered</a> California to dramatically reduce the population of its prisons.</p>\n<p>To do so, instead of seeking significant sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders, Gov. Jerry Brown decided to shift responsibility for most low-level criminals from state prison to county jail, where conditions were not regulated under the court order.</p>\n<p>In some counties, this process ‚Äî euphemistically called ‚Äúrealignment‚Äù ‚Äî didn‚Äôt prove to be much of a problem, because they had space in their jails to spare, or made space to spare, but a <a href=\"http://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/child-page/183091/doc/slspublic/Petersilia%20VOICES%20no%20es%20Final%20022814.pdf\">third</a> of California‚Äôs state prison population comes from Los Angeles. Within two years, an additional 8,000 inmates, including Barr, were serving time in L.A. County jails.</p>\n<p>Fire camps had always been for state prisoners, not county inmates, because Cal Fire and the CDCR consider it a waste of money to train firefighters who have less than a year of time to serve. So with most low-level offenders no longer being housed at state prison, fire camps must negotiate separate contracts with individual counties, as they did with Los Angeles, in order to keep their barracks full. Barr is one of 528 L.A. County inmates who <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/17/local/la-me-0918-jail-problems-20130918\">began</a> filling five local fire camps at the end of last year. To inspire similar deals elsewhere, Brown‚Äôs 2014‚Äì2015 budget included major financial incentives for counties to send their low-level offenders to fire camp. And to encourage inmates like Barr to sign up, county inmates who go to fire camp serve only 35% of their sentences, even as their counterparts from state prison serve 50% or even 80%.</p>\n<p>But in the next few years, California <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141012-story.html\">may see more</a> serious sentencing reform, which would help bring nonviolent drug offenders back to their families faster but would significantly damage the state‚Äôs firefighting capabilities at a time when every penny counts.</p>\n<p>Already, in 2012, voters passed a law that eliminated life sentences for most third-strike nonviolent offenders; next week, voters will likely pass a ballot measure called Proposition 47 that would go even further, downgrading drug possession and minor property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. And at the end of September, Brown signed a bill that will reduce sentences for crack sales to the same level as cocaine sales, starting in 2015. Lynne Lyman, Drug Policy Alliance‚Äôs California state director, said she hopes this legislative win signals Brown will tackle more comprehensive sentencing reform for drug dealers if he is elected to a second term in November.</p>\n<p>After all, most people, other than law enforcement lobbying groups, now see the war on drugs as well intentioned but overzealous, sidelining perfectly good workers and making it difficult for them to re-enter the legitimate economy.</p>\n<p>So in the coming years, as fires increase and low-level prisoners go home earlier, California will need to make a choice: Pay full price for its firefighting workforce, or send more violent inmates out into the wilderness with powerful tools and very little security.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143395\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"721\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 673px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143395','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Barr had never used a chainsaw before, and it was lighter in his hands than he expected it to be. Over the course of the spring, as more and more inmates arrived from L.A. County jail, Barr had started to settle into the role of veteran. By the beginning of summer, Holton had transferred the bulk of its state prisoners to help fill spots at other fire camps around California.</p>\n<p>Only 10 now draw from the county jail population, and because lower-level offenders are no longer being housed at state prison, there are far fewer nonviolent inmates available to supply the other 32. Inmates are qualifying who never would have five years ago.</p>\n<p>So the foreman suggested Barr skip a few ranks and move right to the front, as the sawyer. ‚ÄúI got a lot of pull,‚Äù Barr explained. ‚ÄúEveryone knows me.‚Äù He revved the engine and contemplated the tangle of scrub oak blocking the path before him.</p>\n<p>The CDCR says it thoroughly evaluates every prisoner firefighter. But in 2011, before realignment even began, the <i>Redding Record-Searchlight</i>, a newspaper in Northern California, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/inmates-man-fire-lines\">investigated</a> the fire camp population between 2005 and 2010 and found that, despite the CDCR‚Äôs supposedly strict screening, a fifth of all inmate firefighters had committed violent crimes, including carjacking, armed robbery, and manslaughter.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no perfect litmus test to determine whether a convicted criminal will take the firefighting job seriously, or whether he will just do the minimum necessary to stay in camp. And nonviolent drug offenders aren‚Äôt even necessarily the most cooperative of the criminal population: <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230601065_RISK_FACTORS_FOR_VIOLENT_BEHAVIOR_IN_PRISON_INMATES_A_Cross-Cultural_Contribution/links/09e41501da0e49503d000000\">Studies</a> show those who committed violent crimes are not more likely than nonviolent criminals to be violent once incarcerated.</p>\n<p>The challenge, Barr realized, as one branch, then another, fell to his feet, was in the angles. How were you supposed to know where to start the chop, and which direction to slash in? Surrounded by the stench of gasoline, Barr took another step forward, but before he knew what was happening, the chain got caught on something and slammed to a stop. Still running, the saw convulsively rebounded, bucking backward into his legs with unexpected torque.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTwice. I cut myself twice,‚Äù he said. He didn‚Äôt get hurt, but he did manage to slice through his chaps, which are made from several layers of Kevlar, a material often used in body armor because it is five times stronger than steel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTwice!‚Äù he said again, as though he can‚Äôt even believe he was allowed to keep using the saw after cutting his chaps the first time. ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôre like, you know, we‚Äôll just make you a bucker.‚Äù The bucker walks a few feet behind the sawyer, grabbing the brush as it falls and tossing it away from the flames.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúGood thing I had those chaps,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Trusting an inexperienced criminal with a chainsaw hints at the peculiar, simultaneous empowerment and dehumanization that prisoner firefighters experience. And the use of such powerful machinery is one of the most controversial aspects of fire camp. But most people are less concerned about whether inmates will hurt themselves unintentionally and more worried about whether any criminal should be handed such potentially harmful tools of destruction.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe extend a lot of trust,‚Äù said Lt. Dave Foote, who commands Camp No. 11, in Acton. ‚ÄúThe first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw I thought, <i>Man, I made a wrong decision to come here</i>.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even a polite inmate, a trustworthy inmate, might be cutting line in the wilderness one morning and then suddenly run off into the woods with his Pulaski axe. When firefighters take custody of the inmates during the day, there are no CDCR guards around to protect them. It‚Äôs just 15 to 17 inmates, alone in the middle of nowhere with chainsaws, axes, rakes, and two or three firefighters.</p>\n<p>Holton is one of only two camps in the state surrounded by a low fence; the other 40 are wide open. Holton is also less than a mile away from Angeles Shooting Range, where you can buy and repair guns, pick up some ammo, or take an accuracy class. Ron Cottriel, the 74-year-old manager there, says he never worries about the safety of his staff and his customers, despite being so close to a hundred prisoners.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúCriminals are stupid, but they‚Äôre not that stupid,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come in here and expect to do harm when everybody is armed.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then again, about <a href=\"http://www.mendocinobeacon.com/ci_23726595/state-prison-changes-continue-shifting-more-violent-felons\">half</a> the people who escaped from California prisons in 2011 and 2012 were prisoner firefighters. In 2005, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/mother-murdered-officer-continues-pushed-fire-camp\">an inmate</a> walked away from a fire camp in Humboldt County; after nearly two years on the run, he shot and killed a San Francisco police officer.</p>\n<p>Back when he was a state senator, Congressman Doug LaMalfa attempted to pass legislation that would provide more detailed information to the firefighters who take custody during the day about the criminal history of the inmates they are overseeing. Brown vetoed the bill, calling it unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Now LaMalfa worries that we are too trusting, especially given the rising number of violent offenders at camps still supplied by state prison populations. After all, many of the projects that inmate firefighters do during the day, including landscaping at public parks, happen in and around towns.</p>\n<p>LaMalfa asked, ‚ÄúDo you really want your kids to walk anywhere near where that‚Äôs going on?‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143377\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"686\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 638px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>As the truck wended its way up Highway 32, Barr surveyed the mountains from the window, noting that there was manzanita up here too, just like near Holton. It was after sunrise on Tuesday, July 29, and he and his crew were a few hours outside of San Francisco, about to begin their second 24-hour shift in three days.</p>\n<p>One of their usual foremen had just been transferred, and a new guy who had never worked with inmates had come to take his place, but Barr wasn‚Äôt worried. He knew what he was doing. This fire, the Web Fire, was a minor incident, having burned fewer than 500 acres, and the one he had worked the day before, the Sand Fire, had been mostly extinguished by the time crew two showed up to do what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmop-up.‚Äù He was only four months from freedom.</p>\n<p>When they parked, the temperature outside was only 70 degrees, but over the course of the day it was supposed to climb to 102. Throwing 40-pound packs on over their gear, they set off on a three-hour hike west into Web Hollow.</p>\n<p>Soon they reached their assigned area at the southern edge of the fire and got to work. Other than occasional shouts to ‚ÄúBump up!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBump down!‚Äù the mountain, the crew stayed quiet as they trekked sideways across the steep incline. It was too intense to talk.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was treacherous, going up that mountain,‚Äù Barr told me. ‚ÄúWe hiked it like three times, then we had to go back down and get water, and then we had to go back up there and sleep, and watch the mountain. The mountain was still on fire.‚Äù</p>\n<p>As the time ticked by, Barr‚Äôs body fell into the rhythm established by a year of grueling hikes and daily practice. The physical exertion, the mental stress, the imminent dangers ‚Äî none of it really bothered him anymore. The only thing he never felt he could fully adjust to and forget about was the heat: the sticky, oppressive heat.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, when Barr got off his shift, he was taken to the nearest fire camp an hour away. He ate some fruit and a breakfast burrito, took a shower, and prepared for his next 24-hour shift, which started the following morning. Several hundred miles from home, he was exhausted from sleeping on the rocky ground, he was dusted with soot from head to toe, and he was being escorted around camp by a tough CDCR guard who cut him no slack.</p>\n<p>But he was comfortable, grateful ‚Äî happy, even, that he didn‚Äôt have to spend this past year surrounded by 131 other criminals in a loud, disgusting room, with <i>Iron Man</i> playing on repeat. Even as he insisted that the experience hasn‚Äôt changed him, as a person, he admitted that fire camp turned the time he had to serve from something soul-crushing into something productive. He does feel angry, though, when he thinks about how much cash he‚Äôll be leaving with ‚Äî maybe $1,200 at most for an entire year of work.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPshh, this might be beyond slavery, whatever this is,‚Äù Barr told me, leaning forward to rest his arms onto the fire camp picnic table. He spoke with more confidence and ease than he had at any point in the past year, casually dismissing the previous day‚Äôs labor as easy in one breath while comparing the foremen to overseers in the next. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have a whip. That‚Äôs the difference,‚Äù he said. He laughed.</p>\n<p>The one thing he did know, as he contemplated what he‚Äôd do once he got out: He didn‚Äôt want to be a firefighter unless he had absolutely no other choice for employment. He‚Äôd never gotten over the physical discomfort of being around the hot flames. Every time was like the first time. It was counterintuitive to get this close to such heat, like jumping into an oven.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not easy for inmate firefighters to make the transition into professional firefighting. Wildland firefighter jobs are so competitive that 200 or 300 applications might come in for one opening, and Cal Fire is reluctant to promote the fact that they might hire well-trained felons over people with no criminal record, even for seasonal jobs. The Los Angeles County Fire Department won‚Äôt hire felons at all. Still, an estimated 3 to 5% of inmates do make the jump, often by working with the U.S. Forest Service. But Barr would really prefer to do something else.</p>\n<p>He explained he‚Äôd been practicing his algebra; reading up on stocks, bonds, and real estate; and savoring Machiavelli‚Äôs <i>The Prince</i>. He‚Äôd also been really into biographies lately because he likes reading about real people who achieve success. ‚ÄúI got plans to be a millionaire when I get out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just gotta figure out how.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the end of September, California announced that it had run through the fiscal year‚Äôs entire wildfire budget in only three months and would need to start tapping into reserves meant for all natural disasters. The now never-ending fire season continues unabated, but any hopes that the federal government might offer additional help fizzled in August, when a bill that would increase funding for wildfire suppression died in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Now the state must figure out how to do more with less. And one of the best ways to save money when fighting fires? Send in the inmates. The CDCR confirmed it does plan to open at least one new camp in the next few years.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah, we get exploited as far as the money, but I love going out there,‚Äù Barr said. ‚ÄúIt makes time go by.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143438\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-28764-1414694800-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2370\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 2322px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143438','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-28764-1414694800-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143040\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

The house we‚Äôve been ogling is an otherwise unremarkable, well-tended beige two-story in a neighborhood of similar-looking dwellings in Fontana, a parched, charmless city 50 miles east of Los Angeles. It belongs to Juan‚Äôs cousin ‚ÄúPablo‚Äù (his name has been changed to maintain the integrity of the investigation), whose identity Lozano has been using for years as he‚Äôs eluded detection, living in Mexico with Bianca. Lessan‚Äôs theory ‚Äî or one of her many theories ‚Äî is that Juan and/or Bianca could be in the house today. As she told me yesterday, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my feeling these two have crossed the border and are back in the U.S.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the moment, though, there‚Äôs no sign of anyone. Three cars are parked in front and Lessan has jotted down the corresponding license plate numbers, but none have moved in the three hours since we got here. We‚Äôre in the backseat, partially obscured by the tinted windows ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we sit in front, it looks suspicious,‚Äù Lessan says ‚Äî studying photos of Lozano and Bianca so we‚Äôll be able to recognize them should we spot them.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs all Lessan is hoping for today. She‚Äôs considered simply knocking on the door, but ultimately decided doing so could ‚Äúburn‚Äù her ‚Äî if Lozano isn‚Äôt there, Pablo might tip him off, and then Lozano would go even deeper underground.</p>\n<p>Lessan has been a licensed investigator for 21 years but hardly fits the traditional gumshoe profile. She‚Äôs a woman in a field dominated by men and has never worked in law enforcement or the military. From the minute I meet her, she‚Äôs warm and chatty. She‚Äôs slender, with long black hair, and today is wearing a black T-shirt, tight jeans, and sunglasses. Her words tend to tumble out in a stream-of-consciousness rush, and she‚Äôs prone to darting from subject to subject. Often these digressions slingshot the conversation back to Lessan‚Äôs favorite subjects: She hosts a weekly internet radio show devoted to discussing UFO sightings, the Illuminati, weather modification, and the like. On the ride out to Fontana, she casually, almost dismissively, explained how a small group of families, including the Rothschilds, the Clintons, the Bushes, and the Windsors, run the world, and that Dwight Eisenhower shook hands with aliens in 1954.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4088446\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"528\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 480px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4088446','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Deana and Bianca </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Lessan has been working on this case since August 2013, and she represents something of a Hail Mary in this nearly two-decade-long search. Bianca‚Äôs mother, Deana Hebert, whose Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissingBianca\">@missingbianca</a>, has exhausted all of her resources and enlisted anyone and everyone she can ‚Äî the police, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the DA‚Äôs office, the Mexican Consulate, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, her congressman, multiple private investigators, several lawyers, family members, friends, volunteers ‚Äî to look for her daughter. That they‚Äôve all failed says as much about the slapdash, numbingly bureaucratic ‚Äî if well-intentioned ‚Äî system we have in this country for finding long-term missing children as it does about anything else. As Hebert put it, ‚ÄúNobody wants to be responsible for anything in this case. Nobody wants to be in charge. It‚Äôs just me pushing and pushing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If you were a parent whose daughter was abducted, how much would you pay for her safe return? Even the most well-meaning PIs must navigate the murky moral quandary of what is appropriate to charge a desperate parent to deliver the very thing in the universe they hold most dear. A friend of Hebert‚Äôs paid to hire Lessan ‚Äî the third PI who‚Äôs been on the case ‚Äî and right now this house in Fontana is her only viable lead. If we see either Lozano or Bianca today, the plan is to call Hebert so she can fly out from Texas to meet the fully grown woman she hasn‚Äôt seen since she was her 20-month-old toddler, and to contact Lessan‚Äôs friend who works as an investigator for Homeland Security, who could arrest Lozano.</p>\n<p>As morning turns to afternoon, Lessan‚Äôs getting antsy. She begins to consider going against her original instinct and knocking on that front door ‚Äî there‚Äôs a yearning to do something, <i>anything</i>, to make the time spent feel like it wasn‚Äôt a total waste. Just as she‚Äôs on the verge of going to the door and potentially ruining six months of investigation, she catches a break: Girl Scouts. Walking down the street are two young girls and a mother, pulling a wagon behind them, going door to door selling cookies.</p>\n<p>We duck down in the van‚Äôs backseat as the Girl Scouts pass by. They ring Pablo‚Äôs doorbell, wait, then begin to walk away, when the door opens. A little girl, about 6 or 7 years old, stands in the doorway.

Or maybe it‚Äôs 350,000. Or 2,000. In truth, no one really knows. The last year a <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/196465.pdf\">study</a> was done by the Justice Department was 1999. It claimed an estimated 1.3 million kids went missing that year and that 203,900 of those were taken by a family member. Those stats have been regurgitated for 15 years, and while there are significant questions as to how accurate they were back then, they‚Äôre certainly next to useless a decade and a half later. (A Justice Department spokesperson says there is a new report in the works, but it‚Äôs not expected to be published for at least a year.)</p>\n<p>The FBI tracks annual crime statistics and <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2013\">reported</a> that in 2013, 462,567 children went missing. Of those, 2,310 were abducted by a noncustodial parent. This is a number that, according to FBI statistics, has remained relatively static going back to at least 2007. It‚Äôs also a number rendered mostly worthless by the methodology behind it: When missing persons reports are filed by law enforcement, specifying the cause of the disappearance is optional.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMissing person entries are made primarily by the local law enforcement agency shortly after the missing person report is made,‚Äù Stephen Fischer Jr., chief of multimedia productions in the FBI‚Äôs Criminal Justice Information Services Division, explains in an email. ‚ÄúHaving the correct name, date of birth and basic physical description is the primary concern. While the circumstances surrounding the incident will be collected as the investigation moves forward, the missing person entry will often not reflect this data.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This partially accounts for the enormous discrepancy between the FBI‚Äôs count and the Justice Department‚Äôs 1999 research. Still, nearly half those 2013 missing child reports <i>did</i> specify a cause, so following that logic, the number of children abducted by a family member each year falls somewhere between 4,620 and 203,900. Maybe. Robert L. Snow, a retired captain with the Indianapolis police who has written multiple <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IXU3JG/?tag=buzz0f-20\">books</a> about kidnapping, thinks even the DOJ‚Äôs study undercounts parental abductions.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt realize that a lot of abductions, particularly family abductions, are never reported,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want to air their dirty laundry. I have found research that says it could be as high as 350,000 parental abductions a year. ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much apathy. No one realizes how big a problem this is.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089771\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"778\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 730px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089771','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Elizabeth Smart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089821\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"938\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 890px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089821','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jaycee Dugard </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Carl Probyn / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This is pretty much how it goes when it comes to missing children in America. Despite huge amounts of sensationalistic coverage lavished on a few rare cases ‚Äî Elizabeth Smart, Jaycee Dugard, etc. ‚Äî for the most part, hardly anyone is paying attention. This is especially true of parental abductions, which everyone agrees ‚Äî terrible stat-keeping notwithstanding ‚Äî are far more common than the classic ‚Äústranger-danger‚Äù kidnapping most parents live in mortal fear of. (The 1999 DOJ study counted a grand total of 115 of these so-called ‚Äústereotypical kidnappings‚Äù that year.)</p>\n<p>According to Snow, most parental abductions tend to get resolved pretty quickly. In a percentage of these cases ‚Äî again, who knows exactly what percentage ‚Äî the parent is merely a few hours late returning with the child. In others, a call from the police or a lawyer threatening harsh consequences resolves the situation. Sometimes, the abductor has the intent to stay gone but no real plan, and authorities track him or her down in a matter of hours or days. It‚Äôs when days become weeks, months, and even years that whatever systems we have in place seem to break down completely.</p>\n<p>When the abductor leaves the country, the situation grows even more complicated. The Hague Abduction Convention, a 1980 treaty that has been agreed to by 92 countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, sets guidelines for the return of children kidnapped across international borders, but, in reality, even many countries that have signed it don‚Äôt comply with it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen you go to a foreign country, an American warrant doesn‚Äôt mean much,‚Äù says Snow. ‚ÄúA lot of times you can‚Äôt get the local authorities to cooperate. A lot of countries are of the opinion that children are better off being raised in their country than in the United States. The U.S. can try to put pressure, but they don‚Äôt have much leverage. They‚Äôre not going to cut off aid or start a war over one child.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089988\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"424\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 376px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Deana Hebert was worried the minute her then-husband walked out the door with their daughter. The couple were in midst of an ugly divorce, and Lozano had arrived on a Friday in April in 1995 to pick up Bianca for the weekend. Hebert was living with her parents in a small house in Baytown, a Houston suburb, and their custody arrangement meant Bianca spent most of the time with her. Lozano had her on Wednesdays and every other weekend.</p>\n<p>Hebert was born and raised in Baytown, and Lozano had moved there from Monterrey, Mexico, when he was a child. They were an odd couple: He was 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds; she was 5-foot-5, 100 pounds, and five years younger. These days, with all that‚Äôs happened, Hebert has trouble remembering what first drew them together. ‚ÄúI guess he made me laugh,‚Äù she says. They dated for about two years and married a month before Bianca was born, when Hebert was just 21. Lozano lost his job, leaving Hebert the family‚Äôs sole breadwinner. He grew moody and eventually abusive toward Hebert.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe was so scary,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Jekyll and Hyde. He can be so sweet and then so extreme opposite. If I‚Äôd stayed I would‚Äôve ended up dead.‚Äù She and Bianca moved into her parents‚Äô house, and she filed for divorce.</p>\n<p>Every time Lozano came to pick up Bianca, it was an ordeal. One Wednesday in January, Lozano got rough and dragged Hebert outside. She called the cops and filed charges for assault, but their custody arrangement remained unaltered.</p>\n<p>That Friday in April, Hebert sensed something was wrong. With Lozano scheduled to appear in court for the assault, their already troubled relationship was near its lowest point. Although Lozano and Bianca weren‚Äôt due to return until Sunday evening, Hebert was on edge the whole weekend. When he didn‚Äôt show up at 6 p.m., as agreed to, she was sure they weren‚Äôt coming back. Her mother tried to reassure her.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy mom goes, ‚ÄòYou know how they run late. He‚Äôs playing games. He‚Äôs probably going to tell you he had to change her diaper.‚Äô‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòNo. They‚Äôre gone.‚Äô And I was right.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090133\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 462px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090133','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs two days after the Fontana stakeout, and Lessan and I are driving, talking about the case ‚Äî specifically why and how Bianca and Juan Lozano would be in the U.S. at the moment.

Lozano‚Äôs parents. Her lawyer. The police. The FBI. As the weeks turned to months and eventually years, a dizzying number of government agencies got involved: Besides the Baytown Police Department and the FBI, an incomplete list includes the U.S. Marshals Service, the Harris County district attorney‚Äôs office, the State Department, the Mexican Consulate, and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat I found is that the agencies don‚Äôt communicate with each other,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo any information I got, I‚Äôd make sure I sent it to the DA‚Äôs detective, Baytown police, FBI, the congressman‚Äôs office. I was the hub.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Managing the investigation into her daughter‚Äôs abduction while simultaneously trying to mourn the loss was not ideal, but during the first year or two she was grateful in some ways to have something to do. For a while, she clung to the belief that the man she once married would eventually come to his senses and bring Bianca back. ‚ÄúI still remember feeling like, <i>Oh, this is going to blow over</i>,‚Äù she says.</p>\n<p>It didn‚Äôt. Her divorce was finalized. After a year or so, the trail was cold. Soon, Hebert was out of money, out of ideas, and trying to figure out how to go on living when her main reason for doing so had been replaced by a giant, unfathomable void.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was so busy at first, involved in everything, and then all of a sudden everything just stopped,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to grieve. I just put everything in a compartment in my head and kind of left it there.‚Äù But she eventually realized if she didn‚Äôt want to live out her days as the empty shell she felt like, she had to start filling them with something. ‚ÄúBeing in my twenties and being single, it was hard when you‚Äôd meet somebody and they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòOh, do you have kids?‚Äô Sometimes it was easier just to say no, because when you tell some people that your child was kidnapped, they say, ‚ÄòOh, OK,‚Äô and just go on with the conversation. Then some people freak out and start crying like you‚Äôve dropped a bomb on them.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Eventually she met someone else and got remarried in 1999.

She scoured the internet for any signs of her or Lozano. The month after Bianca disappeared, she had <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1338009.html\">sued</a> Lozano‚Äôs parents, who she believes have been helping him, and at one point won a $2.2 million judgment, though after several years and various appeals, a retrial was ordered and Hebert, her parents, and her attorney made the decision not to go forward. Years later, she tried to repair relations with his family in the hopes that they could facilitate Bianca‚Äôs return. Nothing worked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two different parts of me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one part that‚Äôs Bianca‚Äôs mom, searching and doing all these things, and there‚Äôs the other part that goes on with life and tries to do normal things. But nothing has ever replaced her.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In 2009, 14 years after Bianca‚Äôs initial disappearance, Hebert turned to her congressman, Pete Olson, for help, and met Kimberli Reed, who was Olson‚Äôs director of casework at the time. They forged an immediate bond: In 2002, Reed had had her own children literally snatched from her in a parking lot by her estranged husband. It took five months for her to track them down, and a year before she was granted full custody.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know what I went through for five measly months,‚Äù says Reed. ‚ÄúI have no idea what it would be like to go through this for all this time. It‚Äôs amazing she hasn‚Äôt gone insane.‚Äù</p>\n<p>By the time Reed met Hebert, the investigation into Bianca‚Äôs whereabouts had deteriorated to the point where it could hardly even be called an investigation.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was dead,‚Äù says Reed. ‚ÄúThere were probably seven or eight years in there that no one was doing anything, except for Deana. Baytown PD had totally written it off. Harris County district attorney‚Äôs office had washed its hands of it. The State Department had closed the case. There wasn‚Äôt a notice or a flag put into Homeland Security for Juan. Mexico knew nothing about the case.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Reed took up the cause, and ‚Äúfor the next four years,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI literally spent every day searching for Bianca.‚Äù She tried to use her clout at the congressman‚Äôs office to knock heads together at various government agencies. In 2009, she helped convene a roundtable meeting that included representatives of the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Harris County DA, the Mexican Consulate, and the Mexican attorney general‚Äôs office, with a representative from the State Department conferenced in on the phone. She asked if anyone could contact and question Lozano‚Äôs family.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAll of them looked at Deana and me and said, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nothing we can do,‚Äô‚Äù Reed recalls. The Mexican representatives told her they did not consider Lozano a criminal because Bianca is his daughter. The FBI said that its hands were tied because it had no jurisdiction in Mexico. The State Department staffer said it couldn‚Äôt do anything and made clear that once Bianca turned 18 and was no longer a missing child but a missing adult, the department wouldn‚Äôt work the case at all.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúEveryone kept saying, ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt do anything until we locate her, and we can‚Äôt locate her so we can‚Äôt do anything,‚Äô‚Äù says Reed. Even if it did manage to find Lozano, the Harris County DA wasn‚Äôt even sure if it would extradite him.</p>\n<p>A warrant for Lozano‚Äôs arrest was eventually issued in the U.S., and a few years ago Interpol, which tracks fugitives across international borders, put him on a watch list. At one point, Hebert discovered that if she could pinpoint Lozano in Mexico, U.S. marshals were authorized to bring him back to the U.S. and arrest him. But the Marshals Office told her it wouldn‚Äôt, ‚Äúbecause the original warrant was filed by the FBI, and the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Office [wouldn‚Äôt] work together,‚Äù Hebert tells me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were certain detectives in certain agencies that have been very dedicated,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúOther times, I try to get in touch about something and don‚Äôt hear from them for months. I know they‚Äôre busy, they‚Äôre on other things, this is an old case, but it‚Äôs just frustrating. It would be nice to have one central agency that only worked on missing children‚Äôs cases.‚Äù</p>\n<p>According to Snow, this is a key failing of the current system. ‚ÄúNo one really takes responsibility for abducted children,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a criminal offense, but there‚Äôs no specific agency meant to take these cases.‚Äù Even within the agencies that end up saddled with kidnapping cases, there‚Äôs a distinct lack of expertise. ‚ÄúIn Indianapolis, we‚Äôve got a huge police department, 1,500 officers,‚Äù says Snow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no abduction unit. Very few police departments have a unit specifically trained for this. It just goes to a general officer and he handles this like he handles other cases. So that officer has very little experience and training in it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090445\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"658\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 610px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090445','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs San Diego office is in a modern downtown office building a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. Lessan is there to meet with her friend, Maurice Wrighten, who works as an investigator in the cybercrimes division. Lessan has known him for 15 years, and he seems willing to help but isn‚Äôt certain exactly how. From a manila folder, she pulls out a copy of a Mexican ID card: It‚Äôs Lozano‚Äôs picture but Pablo‚Äôs name and information, and Lozano used it to get a job in Mexico a few years ago. She then pulls out two birth certificates. One is a copy of Bianca‚Äôs legitimate American one; the other is a Mexican one that Lessan has uncovered, with an alias, ‚ÄúFabiola Suarez Elizondo,‚Äù a birth date of more than a year earlier, and Pablo listed as the father.</p>\n<p>Wrighten studies the documents. One of the many complications of Bianca‚Äôs case is that although she was abducted as a child, she‚Äôs now 21. Technically, she‚Äôs an adult, making her own decisions. Since Bianca‚Äôs broken no laws herself, Wrighten can‚Äôt really investigate her.</p>\n<p>Lozano is a different story. Wrighten says the identity fraud is a way in, but ‚Äúif he‚Äôs using a fake Mexican ID in Mexico, that has nothing to do with us. He‚Äôs not breaking any U.S. laws.‚Äù As long as he‚Äôs in Mexico, he‚Äôs beyond the reach of Homeland Security.

Although the NCMEC is ostensibly an independent nonprofit, it gets considerable funding ‚Äî <a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34050.pdf\">$67 million in 2014</a> ‚Äî from the federal government. Opinions on its effectiveness vary wildly. Reed says that the NCMEC is ‚Äúcompletely inept.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAll they do is run a website, create fliers, and that‚Äôs it,‚Äù she says. And when newer photos of Bianca were found, getting it to update the fliers proved an ordeal. ‚ÄúThe entire time I was with the congressman‚Äôs office, they essentially did nothing. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs on our website,‚Äô ‚ÄòWe have flyers out there,‚Äô was all they‚Äôd do.‚Äù (A recent check of Bianca Lozano‚Äôs profile on the NCMEC <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMC/803912/1\">website</a> had an updated photo, but in one spot it misstates the date of her disappearance by 17 years.)</p>\n<p>On its website, the NCMEC claims to have helped recover over 199,000 children since its founding in 1984, with a recovery rate of 97%. When I spoke to Bob Lowery, vice president of the NCMEC‚Äôs Missing Children Division, he said the actual number now is closer to 98% or 99%. Some question these figures, noting that the NCMEC takes credit for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù to recover children in cases it had virtually no involvement in. In some cases, these children were never actually missing (merely reported so by a panicky parent), or were returned by a noncustodial parent within hours of being reported. Critics of the NCMEC say it overstates its usefulness to justify its federal funding, and in doing so distorts public perception about the nature of the problem.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to Marc Klaas, who founded the KlaasKids Foundation to aid in the recovery of missing children after his own daughter, Polly, was abducted and murdered back in 1993, he launched, unprompted, into a bitter condemnation of the NCMEC.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a real beef with these characters,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt really go in the field. They don‚Äôt really get involved in any except the high-profile cases. They‚Äôve done more to harm the missing child ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to call it an industry, but missing child nonprofit organizations ‚Äî than any other single entity out there. They work very hard to make sure every dollar involved in missing children goes directly to them. They don‚Äôt share any resources whatsoever, and I can tell you from personal experience they‚Äôll go out of their way to undermine anybody that might threaten their position. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre just guys in the middle vacuuming up money. I loathe the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and think missing kids would be better served if they didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Lowery, not surprisingly, takes issue with these portrayals.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThose are misinformed impressions about the National Center‚Äôs work,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe work here in the Missing Children‚Äôs Division is much more comprehensive than simply creating a poster and distributing it. ‚Ä¶ All our teams are former law enforcement or social services with a great deal of experience in finding children. We do extensive case analysis work, we work social media, we have law enforcement partners in our building working side by side with us, so when leads come in that need law enforcement activity right away, we‚Äôre getting it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There are dozens of other nonprofits that focus on recovering missing children, though sorting the merely well-intentioned from those actually well-equipped to help can be tricky (never mind the ones devoted mostly to collecting donations, including the Committee for Missing Children, Operation Lookout National Center for Missing Youth, and Find the Children, three of the 50 worst charities in the country, according to an <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/\">investigation</a> by the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> and the Center for Investigative Reporting).</p>\n<p>A few years after Bianca went missing, Hebert met with Mark Miller, founder of the American Association for Lost Children, a nonprofit that, according to its website, conducts ‚Äúhands-on investigations, while traveling in and outside the country performing surveillance and undercover work searching for and rescuing missing children.‚Äù Hebert says Miller convinced another mother whose own children were missing to date one of Lozano‚Äôs cousins in order to try to get information on Lozano‚Äôs whereabouts.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAfter a few dates, in the throes of whatever they were in the middle of, she confessed that she was working for Miller and the whole thing blew up in her face,‚Äù Hebert says. Later, when Hebert was organizing a concert to raise money for her continuing search efforts, she got into a dispute with Miller over what percentage of the proceeds would go to his organization. In the end, she says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know a lot of what he did or didn‚Äôt do working on Bianca‚Äôs case.‚Äù</p>\n<p>(When contacted, Miller says that he encourages all parents to ‚Äúbe on our team,‚Äù and help out with cases other than their own. He contends that although the other mother blew their cover, she did help procure useful information. He also insists that the money he wanted Hebert to donate to his charity was going to directly fund her case. According to Miller, the foundation spent thousands of dollars on Hebert‚Äôs case and she ‚Äúnever donated one penny to the charity.‚Äù)</p>\n<p>With both government agencies and nonprofits often creating more confusion than they alleviate, many parents turn to private investigators. Unfortunately, the world of PIs is possibly even more opaque. Licensing varies from state to state, and in most cases doesn‚Äôt seem particularly rigorous. According to Lessan, the main advantage a licensed investigator has over an unlicensed one is a badge. ‚ÄúTo be honest,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs no difference.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Given this landscape, it‚Äôs not surprising that nightmare stories of PIs ripping off parents are legion. In 2009, an investigator in Arizona was <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/local/crime/counts-of-wire-fraud-for-local-man/article_a92d794a-f880-5174-be33-c9ce81251484.html\">indicted</a> on five counts of wire fraud relating to charges that he created a fake abducted child recovery company, Delta International, which collected huge fees from parents and delivered virtually nothing in return. Gus Zamora, an ex‚ÄìArmy Ranger whose renown for recovering children abducted internationally has garnered him features on <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/39080442#39080442\"><i>Dateline</i></a> and in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/11/the-snatchback/307704/\"><i>The Atlantic</i></a>, has also been accused, <a href=\"http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/zamora-and-associates-fraud-conman-ripoff-c610013.html\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.zamoraandassociates.ca/about.html\">times</a>, of defrauding parents.</p>\n<p>Hebert first hired a PI based in Houston a few months after Lozano absconded with Bianca. She says she traveled to Mexico four times with this investigator, who insisted he‚Äôd seen Bianca while doing surveillance down there for her.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe were going to go down there again, rent a plane, hire these guys with guns, kidnap my daughter, and bring her back,‚Äù says Hebert. But she wasn‚Äôt too confident in this plan, and was running out of money. Around the same time, she met Don Feeney, an ex‚ÄìDelta Force commando working in private security consulting, who‚Äôd helped retrieve kidnapped children before. She decided to spend the last $10,000 she could get her hands on ‚Äî money that her mother had to borrow from Hebert‚Äôs grandparents ‚Äî to pay Feeney to follow up on the earlier investigator‚Äôs information. ‚ÄúThey came back and said, ‚ÄòThis is not your daughter and not your ex-husband. You would‚Äôve been in a world of trouble if you‚Äôd kidnapped that girl and tried to come back here with her.‚Äô It was crazy.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090605\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090605','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In April 2013, Hebert finally caught a break. A man got in touch via a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nina-Suarez-seguimos-buscandote/214673721899196\">Facebook page</a> she‚Äôd set up, telling her that his sister Norma had had a baby with Lozano, whom she knew as ‚ÄúPablo.‚Äù She had lived with him and Bianca ‚Äî whom she knew as ‚ÄúNina‚Äù ‚Äî in Monterrey, Mexico, but Lozano was abusive, and now Norma was on the run from him. She‚Äôd begun to grow suspicious about his past, and after finding the Facebook page Hebert had set up, was concerned Lozano would kidnap her own son, so she took the boy and went into hiding.</p>\n<p>In a series of conversations Hebert and a Spanish-speaking friend had with Norma‚Äôs brother and father, Hebert began hearing the first details of her daughter‚Äôs life, most of them heartbreaking: Bianca had been told that her mother died during childbirth. She lived in fear of her father. She had no idea she was a U.S. citizen and didn‚Äôt even know her real name. She was diabetic, played the guitar, and although she had no formal education, took classes at a music school in Monterrey.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI desperately wanted to talk to Norma because she‚Äôs the only person I know that knows my daughter,‚Äù says Hebert. But Norma‚Äôs family kept her hidden, fearing for her and her son‚Äôs safety. Still, working off these leads, Hebert and Reed found a Russian pen pal of Bianca‚Äôs named Natalia, who told them they thought Lozano monitored all of Bianca‚Äôs online communication. Around this time, Hebert was also directed to some short YouTube clips of her daughter playing guitar.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090506\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"301\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 253px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090506','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThat was when I saw her for the first time in 18 years,‚Äù says Hebert. ‚ÄúI knew it was her.

Hebert has mostly dismissed the possibility that the red-haired woman we saw here days earlier could be her daughter but believes if we talk to Pablo, he might have some clues as to where Lozano and Bianca might be. Lessan wanted to wait to see what Wrighten came up with, and still worries that if she confronts Pablo, he‚Äôll immediately call Lozano with the information. But as Hebert put it during a three-way call with Reed and Lessan the night before, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he going to tell Juan? That I have an investigator? I think he knows that from what we‚Äôve put on Facebook. We‚Äôre not going to be any worse off than we are now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs late afternoon and the plan is to wait until Pablo gets home from work, then knock on the door. If he doesn‚Äôt slam it in our faces, Hebert has given us a letter for him that explains her plight. So we wait. And wait. One of the women we saw the other day ‚Äî short, ponytail, late thirties or early forties ‚Äî arrives home and goes inside. We wait some more. It‚Äôs now almost 7 p.m. and getting dark outside. Where is Pablo? We discuss the possibilities. Maybe he works from home. Maybe he‚Äôs unemployed. Maybe he‚Äôs out with friends. Time isn‚Äôt on our side. Waiting any longer as it gets darker is going to make an already tense doorway confrontation all the more unsettling. Lessan decides it‚Äôs time.</p>\n<p>She knocks on the door and a female voice from the other side asks, ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis is Monique. I just wanted to show you something.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The door opens to reveal the woman with the ponytail, presumably Pablo‚Äôs wife. Lessan flashes her private investigator license and explains that we are looking for Pablo, but refuses to explain why. Pablo‚Äôs not home, we‚Äôre told, but will be soon. The woman asks if Lessan would like to leave a message for him.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can just wait,‚Äù says Lessan. ‚ÄúI prefer to talk to him, actually.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the woman says warily. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let him know.‚Äù Then she closes the door.</p>\n<p>So the wait continues, now on the sidewalk in front of the house. We debate whether Pablo will ever come home tonight, what he‚Äôll say if he does, and how long we can stand around out here on a Wednesday night before someone calls the cops.</p>\n<p>By the time Pablo pulls up it‚Äôs past 8 p.m. We walk toward him in his driveway, just as his wife comes out the front door again. Lessan introduces herself and asks if we can come inside to show him some information. He looks at us the way you would look at any two strangers who just accosted you in your driveway on a dark Wednesday night insisting, somewhat frantically, that they wanted to come into your house. Lessan presses the case, asking again if we can just come inside for a minute. Pablo and his wife don‚Äôt look wary anymore, they look downright scared.</p>\n<p>Lessan changes tack and tries to hand Pablo the letter Hebert wrote for him. He recoils from the envelope as if it was radioactive, and mumbles something about not knowing what legal implications might come with accepting the letter. I offer to read it aloud. Nobody objects, so I do.</p>\n<p>The letter explains Hebert‚Äôs entire agonizing, Kafkaesque, two-decade-long ordeal ‚Äî the kidnapping, the identity theft, the fruitless searching, the pain of not knowing. It seems to settle the moment. Pablo and his wife look stunned. Lessan asks if she can show them some documentation right here in the driveway. We move under an outdoor floodlight and she lays out the same documents she showed Wrighten on the hood of the family‚Äôs car, building the case, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>When she‚Äôs done, Pablo shakes his head. He hasn‚Äôt seen his cousin Juan Lozano since they were kids. He doesn‚Äôt know anything about the kidnapping. He didn‚Äôt even know he had been married or had kids. He saw Lozano‚Äôs parents last year when they came to California for a funeral, but other than that, he‚Äôs had hardly any contact with that branch of the family in decades. He expresses a willingness to help find out where his cousin is, but quite sensibly, seems most concerned with the fact that Lozano ‚Äî an international fugitive ‚Äî is running around using his identity.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs possible that Pablo is lying about all this, and that Lozano and Bianca are hiding in the house right behind us, but I don‚Äôt think so. Standing here in the driveway, he and his wife don‚Äôt look like accessories to an international abduction. They look like shell-shocked parents. Lessan thanks them for their time, and Pablo promises to get in touch once he‚Äôs talked to some of his family.</p>\n<p>Back in the minivan, Lessan phones Hebert and Reed. As she drives and talks, she‚Äôs emotional, buzzing with adrenaline. She offers a blow-by-blow account of the evening, pausing every few seconds to take a deep breath, and concludes that it went very well.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe wants to help,‚Äù she says, exhaling deeply. ‚ÄúHe was very concerned. He wouldn‚Äôt give us his phone number but said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm going to make some calls and get in touch with you.‚Äô I‚Äôm glad at his response. Hopefully something will come out of it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090528\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:19\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090528','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a long time, nothing does. For months, there‚Äôs no word from Pablo, nothing of note from Wrighten, and after the momentary excitement in Fontana, the investigation has settled back into low gear. There‚Äôs no more money for Lessan. All the leads from Norma have been chased down and come to nothing.</p>\n<p>In late March, I call Hebert and ask how she‚Äôs feeling about the state of the search. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same old thing ‚Äî another dead end,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe spent all this money, and yeah, we made contact with the cousin, but he hasn‚Äôt done anything. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs ever interested in helping.‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúEverything I do turns up nothing, so I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore. I don‚Äôt let myself get too excited about anything because honestly I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I‚Äôm at the point where ‚Äî I‚Äôm not done, but it‚Äôs getting to be too much.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then in May, Pablo calls. He‚Äôs apologetic for not getting in touch sooner, but as Hebert puts it, ‚ÄúHe was shocked and felt kind of violated. ‚Ä¶ He has had to process it on his own.‚Äù He suggests the outlines of a possible deal: If Hebert drops the charges against her ex-husband, maybe Lozano would allow Bianca to return to the U.S. and be reunited with her. Hebert immediately agrees. Pablo says they‚Äôd need the agreement in writing.</p>\n<p>Hebert emails the Harris County assistant district attorney, who makes clear this isn‚Äôt something they normally do ‚Äî ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt negotiate with felons. This is not justice‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî but they‚Äôll make an exception. Hebert sends the letter to Pablo, and for the first time in a very long time, she allows herself a measure of optimism.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWho knows what this is going to turn into, but I have a little hope this is going to work out,‚Äù she says. I tell her that it seems like a smart move for Lozano. Whatever his situation in Mexico might be right now, having to keep hawkish watch over a 21-year-old woman is hardly the same as doing so with a young girl. That can‚Äôt be much of a life for him. Perhaps he wants out.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I think,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverybody I‚Äôve talked to says, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs stupid if he doesn‚Äôt do this. He‚Äôll be free.‚Äô‚Äù She‚Äôs thought a lot about what a reunion with her daughter might actually be like. They haven‚Äôt seen each other in nearly 20 years. Her daughter has no memory of her. They‚Äôd effectively be strangers. Would Bianca move in? Would she call her ‚ÄúMom‚Äù? Who knows, but if nothing else, she‚Äôd know the truth.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHer friends [at music school] told me her dream was to be an American citizen and play music here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverything in her life is a lie: her name, her birthday, her dad‚Äôs name, where he came from. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs got to be a terrible life. She could have so much if she came here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For the next few days, there are droplets of news. An uncle of Lozano‚Äôs believes the deal is a good idea and will try to talk to his sister ‚Äî Lozano‚Äôs mom ‚Äî about it. Other family members apparently agree.</p>\n<p>Then for a month, there‚Äôs little word at all. Finally, Pablo calls Lozano‚Äôs mom himself but can‚Äôt reach her. He sends a letter to Lozano‚Äôs sister that goes unanswered. When I speak to Hebert in mid-June, she‚Äôs frustrated.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre dragging their feet,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt want to tell Bianca. I‚Äôm not sure how you tell someone their entire life is a lie.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Two more months pass and I call to get an update.

After all this ‚Äî not just these recent events, but years of struggle with cops, private detectives, federal agencies, a congressman, Mexican authorities, nonprofits, volunteers, friends, family, acquaintances, and yes, journalists, with those who were helpful and those who weren‚Äôt, dealing with a system seemingly incapable of marshaling its best resources to grapple with a problem that should be solvable ‚Äî Hebert finds herself no closer to getting her daughter back than she was in 1995. She hasn‚Äôt exactly lost hope, but having been through so much with so many people, at the moment, she‚Äôs feeling very much alone.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe thing is about stories like this, people will see it, read it, maybe post it on Facebook, but then they move on with their lives,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sitting back here waiting for my daughter to show up.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4082943\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

He didn‚Äôt want to show his face on camera, and I didn‚Äôt care whether it was because he was famous, married, or ugly. The internet was so slow that the sound stalled, so the dirty talk had to be typed.</p>\n<p>It was a terse, space-economizing raunch, pounded out letter by letter with his left index finger, since his dominant hand was busy. I WANT TO VERB YOUR NOUN. But the artlessness was a relief. The more work it took to type, the less likely he‚Äôd waste time asking about my hospital bed and IV rack. If I didn‚Äôt mind him being headless and talking like a filthy grown-up ‚Äúsee spot run,‚Äù couldn‚Äôt he handle a naked stranger in a tuberculosis sanatorium?</p>\n<p>Nor did he mention the armband, which hid the nozzle nurses screwed to dripping sacks of drugs during infusions. Three times a week, amikacin seeped down the skinny 2-foot-long tube inside and up my arm, leading behind my collarbone to splash into a big fat artery over my heart.</p>\n<p><i>Just please don‚Äôt fucking ask,</i> I thought. It was exhausting to explain. Screw this guy. Wouldn‚Äôt it be weirder if he <i>had</i> inferred a medical emergency, but resolved not to let it ruin his hard-on? Do virtual strangers without heads even have cognition? What the hell was wrong with this guy‚Äôs face, anyway?</p>\n<p><i>Who cares?</i> I had been in that room in Denver for almost a month. I was days away from lung surgery to remove my upper right lobe, where the bulk of the disease was headquartered. This was the last goddamned time I‚Äôd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars. And it was the skinniest I‚Äôd ever been.</p>\n<p>I had contracted extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB (a severe version of multidrug-resistant, or MDR tuberculosis), while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine. The National Jewish Health Center is no longer a sanatorium, but it is still one of the country‚Äôs top TB research facilities, staffed by worldwide mycobacteria experts and equipped with properly ventilated rooms for the infrequent consumptives who turn up there.</p>\n<p>When I was admitted to the hospital, the state of Colorado dispatched a guy to my hospital room to read me my legal quarantine order. I‚Äôd be in isolation for however long I was contagious.</p>\n<p>During my stay, I started a two-year course of harsh antibiotics, including an IV drip. I had two surgeries, which flanked a blood transfusion and peskily recollapsing lung. I lost 12 pounds and half my blood, which have been replaced, and the upper lobe of my right lung, which hasn‚Äôt. I wish I could be more inspiring. But I didn‚Äôt use that time to write a novel, learn yoga, or even plow through a beach read. Falling into a trance and getting off strangers was all I felt capable of.</p>\n<p>Objectifying? Sure. So is being sick.</p>\n<p>Such isolation ‚Äî both physical and emotional ‚Äî takes a serious toll on TB patients. From the 18th century glory days up to the modern rise of MDR, tuberculosis went from being a relatively universal human experience to being a profoundly lonely one. Isolation and stigma make long treatments even harder to endure and inhibit public consciousness that could lead to more meaningful progress. But we may be approaching a new historical moment: Social media makes it easier than ever for patients to find and support one another. These connections can improve patient morale and treatment outcomes and ultimately raise the profile of MDR-TB in global health policy.</p>\n<p>Because I was never as alone as I thought: Five thousand miles away in Siberia, a woman my age named Ksenia Shchenina was also suffering. So are patients in dozens of other countries, and more and more of them are beginning to use the internet to combat the solitude that has long not only defined the disease and its treatment, but kept it from being eradicated for good.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4041988\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 323px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Most people don‚Äôt spend much time thinking about tuberculosis. If pressed, they might make a few basic generalizations. It was a very serious disease in the olden days. It killed your great-great-grandfather, all of the Bront√´s, and Nicole Kidman‚Äôs character in <i>Moulin Rouge</i>. But then it was cured. It doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. So we‚Äôll all just have to get Ewan McGregor‚Äôs attention some other way and die of something else.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis has been on the scene since ancient times, but it only reached menace status in filthy, urbanizing mid-17th century Europe. It went on to dominate the continent‚Äôs ‚Äúcause of death‚Äù list for over two centuries. This makes sense, if you know how germs work. Poverty and bad sanitation ‚Äî e.g., the Industrial Revolution‚Äôs toxic work conditions and shantytowns ‚Äî made toppling immune systems a cinch. Before germ theory caught on, some people even saw TB as a sort of moral retribution for the sins of modernity.</p>\n<p>Even the disease‚Äôs classic name ‚Äî <i>consumption ‚Äî</i> implied a physical and spiritual connection. It consumed you; it devoured you from within. Before the scientific consensus on how an infectious disease was transmitted, many people assumed a person could be predisposed to consumption. (They caught on to genetics before they unraveled epidemiology.) An entire family of consumptives probably meant they were ill because they had all inherited the proper preconditions for the illness ‚Äî not because they lived together and coughed fatal microbes into one another‚Äôs food. Similarly, researchers couldn‚Äôt help but notice that consumption disproportionately seized writers and artists, whose lifestyle was practically synonymous with urban poverty. But when it was still assumed that the disease grew from within, many scientists searched for a <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gIAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA32&amp;dq=artistic+temperament,+consumption,+cause&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVRuU_v1HaqhsQTso4GoBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=genius&amp;f=false\">link between</a> consumption and genius. This is the kind of factoid that makes you feel smug when modern doctors are really, really surprised that you got this.</p>\n<p>The jig was up in 1882. A German bacteriologist named Robert Koch zeroed in on the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, the bacterial cause of consumption. It spread from person to person <i>by air.</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042155\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"421\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 373px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042155','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Robert Koch </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Ann Ronan Pictures / Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Koch‚Äôs early attempts to develop a vaccine failed, but his efforts did yield a valuable diagnostic tool: the tuberculin skin test. It‚Äôs a shot that scans for TB antibodies. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the disease, the injection site on your forearm will flare up into a BRIGHT RED SKIN MOUNTAIN. The test is still part of routine checkups today among grade-schoolers, teachers, cops, and ‚Äî as I would learn ‚Äî Peace Corps volunteers.</p>\n<p>There is a photo of me on Facebook from early 2010, lodged between a handful of party shots with fellow volunteers. We had traveled to Kiev from across Ukraine to make a weekend out of our mid-service medical checkups. I‚Äôm 23, hamming it up in melodramatic distress, and twisting my left elbow up over my head to show off the swollen red splotch on my forearm.</p>\n<p>A positive skin test usually doesn‚Äôt mean you have TB ‚Äî less than than 10% of people with positive skin tests ever develop an active case, because healthy immune systems can usually defeat the bacterial intruder. Several volunteers each year end up with the telltale red blotch; it was really nothing to worry about. We‚Äôd need a follow-up X-ray, but an active case was highly unlikely. So I cracked a few jokes and went back to pounding flat Chernigivske beers with my friends.</p>\n<p>I had been in Ukraine since September 2008, after studying Russian in college. I volunteered at a school in an eastern mining town called Antratsyt. The town borrows its name from anthracite coal. The region is flat, but you can see hills in the distance ‚Äî they‚Äôre ‚Äúslag heaps,‚Äù or piles of debris extracted from mines. The town only runs water for a few hours a day to protect the mines from mudslides or collapse. But life wasn‚Äôt as bleak as it sounds. I had students who were so excited to practice their English that they would chat with me after school, perched in a row on the edge of a Soviet-era fountain long-since bone-dry. I struck up friendships with their parents and my fellow teachers. I toasted my colleagues over champagne and chocolate on Ukrainian holidays. One time, I even gave a thickly accented speech on international education at a school assembly that ended up on the TV news. I was happy.</p>\n<p>My follow-up X-ray was two weeks later, in Kiev. Taking yet another 17-hour train trip felt like an epic hassle. Is there a word that means the opposite of hypochondriac? There should be, because that‚Äôs what I am. In hindsight, <i>of course</i> I had symptoms ‚Äì I just wrote them off to other things. I had a bad cough, because I was a smoker at the time. I‚Äôd lost weight, because there was no American junk food to lose my will power around. I was run-down and sluggish, because it was the Ukrainian winter!</p>\n<p>I got a ride with Dr. Sasha, one of the Peace Corps‚Äô Ukrainian staffers, to my screening at a tuberculosis dispensary ‚Äî <i>tubdispensar</i> ‚Äî on the edge of the city. He spoke the sort of English that made me self-conscious about my Russian. He carried my Peace Corps medical history file on his lap. The most dramatic thing in it was an allergy to mangoes. (Not exactly a significant handicap in Ukraine.)</p>\n<p>I was X-rayed in a machine that looked like an iron colossus. In the waiting room, I tried to distract myself with a biography of John Adams. (His son, John Quincy, spent years in the Russian Empire as Ambassador and managed to stay consumption-free.) Soviet-era medical facilities are much more dimly lit than their Walmart-bright American counterparts. To see the page, I had to squint.</p>\n<p>The head TB doctor finally called me into the office. He explained the X-ray results and prognosis to Dr. Sasha, who relayed them in English to me. But when Dr. Sasha asked a follow-up question, they flipped back to Russian and cut me out of the triangle. My Russian was good ‚Äì but not ‚Äúunfamiliar medical jargon‚Äù good. But this wasn‚Äôt a conversation I could stand to be excluded from. I was on the brink of a tantrum.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúGod<i>damn</i> it!<i>‚Äù</i> I wanted to shriek at the TB doc. ‚Äú<i>Don‚Äôt</i> say it in <i>his</i> Russian. Say it in <i>mine.‚Äù</i></p>\n<p>My face must have looked like a cartoon teakettle. So he slowed down and turned toward the image pinned to the light board.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúClassic pulmonary TB,‚Äù he said to me. (Words like <i>pulmonary</i> and <i>tuberculosis</i> are cognates.) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that it advanced so quickly. Especially for a healthy young girl.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI heard you guys muttering about bronchitis or pneumonia before. Could it be one of those?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo. We assumed it could have been at first, but this is a clear case. See, on an X-ray, healthy lungs should look solid black. See the contrast down by the lower ribs? But now look up on the right. See the [blahblahblah]? The [blahblahblah] is the tuberculosis.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt get that word. <i>What</i> part is the tuberculosis?‚Äù</p>\n<p>He sighed. It would have been easier to let Dr. Sasha translate. Now he had to dumb down his lexicon for a rattled American.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúUp there. Upper right. Well, left on here. That white spot? The part that looks like a ghost.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That night, I started treatment in a studio apartment the Peace Corps rented for me in Kiev. My prognosis was good. For two weeks, I took pills, got X-rayed, and hocked up sputum ‚Äî a polite word for <i>loogies</i> ‚Äî into sterile plastic cups for lab work. One set stayed in Ukraine; the other was shipped according to special biohazard protocol to an American facility to better coordinate my care at home.</p>\n<p>Eight weeks later, just as life was settling down back in Chicago, I was surprised to find an ominous number of missed calls on my phone: from the diagnostic lab, my mom, my American pulmonologist, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health, my mom, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health Epidemiology Unit, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom.</p>\n<p>Those loogies had yielded bad news. I had XDR-TB. The bad kind.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, I was placed under an isolation order. I was told to stay home whenever possible ‚Äî I could go outside sparingly, but any other indoor space was off-limits until I was noninfectious. A few months, at least. The police could get involved if I didn‚Äôt comply.</p>\n<p>A month into my quarantine, my Chicago doctors were stumped. They‚Äôd rarely seen anything like this.</p>\n<p>So I set off on a journey not unlike those taken by consumptives a century before. I left my bustling, industrial Midwestern city and headed west, to the National Jewish Health Center in Denver.</p>\n<p>It was the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives back then. In 1899, the brand-new philanthropic institution was brimming with needy patients. In 2010, I was the only one.</p>\n<p>I told almost no one where I was going. I had already been avoiding friends who tried to contact me. It is exhausting to have your life flipped around by something people know nothing about. You get so damn sick of telling the story. Weird caveats demand exposition. <i>Here is what I have. Here is why it‚Äôs bad. Here is why I had to evacuate Ukraine and leave the Peace Corps early. Here is why I can‚Äôt be in public or see anyone for the foreseeable future. Here is why I am going to some hospital in Denver for a long time. Here is why they chopped off a big chunk of my lung. Here is why I have this IV armband thing for nine months. Here is why I puke a lot. Here is why food tastes all wrong. Here is why my hearing got warped. Here is why I can‚Äôt feel my toes. Here is why I am not supposed to drink any alcohol. Here is why I‚Äôm still going to anyway.</i></p>\n<p>Since I was on the no-fly list, we drove the 15 hours by car. I wore a mask the whole time so I wouldn‚Äôt infect my parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4041995\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 369px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041995','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives c. 1920 </span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Basic infection control, like isolating the sick and using protective gear to lower transmission risk, may seem primitive compared with modern medicine. But the truth is, public health measures like quarantine and mouth covering did more to eradicate tuberculosis than drugs did. We never did figure out a great way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it. That is, until it caught up with us.</p>\n<p>After Dr. Koch‚Äôs splashy 1882 debut of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</i> the medical community was certain a surefire solution was close behind. But they were disappointed. No cure came.</p>\n<p>Forty years later, a new vaccine ‚Äî Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG ‚Äî entered human testing. But BCG was never that good. Most researchers believe that adults are just as likely to wind up with TB whether they get BCG or not. It also suffered a major PR setback as the center of one of the worst vaccination disasters in history. In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/\">73 babies died of tuberculosis meningitis</a> after being injected with BCG in Lubeck, Germany. The vaccines had been contaminated after getting mixed up with a virulent live TB strain back at the lab. (Life hack: Always be <i>sure</i> your doctor has a label maker.)</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until 1943 that a <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25252/title/The-discovery-of-streptomycin/\">team at Rutgers University</a> pinpointed streptomycin, the world‚Äôs first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis. TB‚Äôs staggering cultural legacy made the discovery a shoo-in for the Nobel Prize, but streptomycin was nonetheless terribly flawed. It was toxic, and patients quickly developed antibodies that resisted the drug. The only solution was to scrape around for more options and blitzkrieg every case of TB with several so-so drugs at once. The first-line regimen has hardly been tweaked in nearly 50 years. It was never a secret that such a long and tedious course of antibiotics would, like a Shakespearean hero, engineer its own demise.</p>\n<p>But that hardly seemed to matter. By the time streptomycin ‚Äòn‚Äô friends showed up, barely anyone even needed them. Throughout the 20th century, people gradually stopped getting TB in the first place. We got healthier, cleaner, and smarter. We could contain disease and catch it early. It nearly disappeared.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 1990s, it bounced back. Two global crises ‚Äî the rise of HIV/AIDS and the fall of the Soviet Union ‚Äî helped resurrect the scourge of the 19th century. The World Health Organization declared a worldwide TB emergency in 1993. (It just goes to show: Don‚Äôt count your eradicated diseases before they hatch.)</p>\n<p>AIDS was even harder on human bodies than the Industrial Revolution had been, and millions of centuries-won immune systems were suddenly wide open to infection anew. TB remains the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/hiv/en/\">leading cause</a> of death among AIDS patients.</p>\n<p>The collapse of the USSR spread TB in even more complicated ways. The year 1991 saw the traumatic birth of 15 brand-new post-Soviet republics. Each of these new countries was in economic and social turmoil. They were broke. They had no central government or public health system. Before their independence, everything had more or less filtered through Moscow. In some places, there were few to no supplies or institutional infrastructure, let alone money for health care workers. Alcoholism and malnourishment soared. People lost their savings. Rampant crime stuffed the prisons ‚Äî notorious hotbeds of TB ‚Äî to well over capacity. Released inmates carted these germs back to their communities. By the time the 15 new countries had smoothed things out, they already had a new old epidemic to battle.</p>\n<p>Even as the immediate post-Soviet crisis improved, other factors played into treatment interruption and new infections. These have been beautifully documented by experts like Dr. Lee Reichman in his 2001 book <i>Timebomb</i> and are easily rattled off by every post-Soviet MDR expert I‚Äôve come across. Treatment in prisons has been badly underfunded, so for years people didn‚Äôt get the meds they needed. There is often subpar follow-up for ill prisoners after they‚Äôre released. Infected migratory workers are tough to treat and track. The Soviet-era mentality of medical specialization has made the region slow to coordinate HIV and TB care. Both illnesses are also correlated with substance abuse, and addicts often turn out to be less-than-diligent patients. In sum, the long, hard treatment places economic, social, and physical strain on patients.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic treatment is an all-or-nothing game. Patients need to take every dose by the book, or germs acquire resistance. Getting it done right depends on stupendous public health programs, not to mention stupendous patients. Once a strain does acquire resistance, it can‚Äôt be undone ‚Äî and the stronger, harder-to-treat germ is passed on to others, like me. If the best drugs don‚Äôt work, doctors are forced to use drugs that are even harder on the body. All of these factors collude to paint a grim reality. In former Soviet countries, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf?ua=1\">only around 60% of patients</a> who begin tuberculosis treatment ever successfully finish it. The rest of them flee, slip through the cracks, fail to respond to treatment, or die before they are cured.</p>\n<p>So it is no surprise that the region has the highest rates of MDR-TB in the world ‚Äî <a href=\"http://www.pih.org/blog/tuberculosis-in-russia-a-qa-with-expert-oksana-ponomarenko\">as many as 30%</a> of all newly detected cases are impervious to first-line drugs. (The global average is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr13_executive_summary.pdf?ua=1\">less than 5%</a>, but statistics are widely believed to be low, especially in resource-poor countries. In the U.S., there were <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6311a2.htm\">fewer than 100 cases</a> of MDR in 2013.) Even in optimal conditions, the difference between a case of run-of-the-mill TB and MDR can be the difference between a moderate inconvenience and a life-threatening catastrophe. A standard case can be cured for less than $100 with a daily dose of four different drugs for six to nine months. My treatment cost taxpayers seven figures and lasted well over two years.</p>\n<p>On paper, many of these problems have already been fixed. A decade ago, Tracy Kidder‚Äôs best-seller <a href=\"http://www.tracykidder.com/books/mountains/\"><i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i></a> lauded the achievements of Dr. Paul Farmer‚Äôs <a href=\"http://www.pih.org\">Partners in Health</a> and other global health organizations in revolutionizing worldwide MDR-TB care. The region‚Äôs TB programs are now relatively well-organized and padded with funding from global health mammoths like the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>. There are detailed and standardized treatment guidelines. TB drugs are fully subsidized. So why are so many patients still failing their treatments?</p>\n<p>Without an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/toward-an-effective-tuberculosis-vaccine/380807/\">effective vaccine</a> or better drugs, efforts to curb MDR-TB face a serious paradox. As a strain becomes more resistant, it becomes simultaneously more painful and more urgent to treat it. Many countries have responded by adopting stringent patient monitoring policies, which improve cure rates but are nonetheless no small imposition in patients‚Äô lives. Public safety overrides patient agency, which is a tough pill for victims to swallow (and they‚Äôve already got plenty of those to worry about).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042055\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"413\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 365px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"We never did figure out a way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it.

Nausea became my baseline. Sometimes the drugs make you puke, or give you the kind of diarrhea that makes you need a nap. One screws with your nervous system, and I permanently lost most of the feeling in my feet. I‚Äôve tracked blood across kitchen floors because I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve stepped on shattered glass.</p>\n<p>And I had it lucky. I had no comorbidities like HIV or diabetes, which make everything even worse. Being on amikacin cost me some low-frequency hearing, but it has caused deafness in others. And I got to take it by IV drip, instead of the painful upper-thigh injections that leave some patients too sore to sit up. And while cycloserine ‚Äî a drug nicknamed ‚Äúpsychoserine‚Äù for its notorious mental and behavioral effects ‚Äî makes some patients hallucinate and scream, I got away with confusion. I had trouble with reading, organization, and paperwork. It‚Äôs an especially tough break if you‚Äôre dealing with a workers‚Äô comp claim for a medical disaster. I couldn‚Äôt keep it all straight, and walloped my credit.</p>\n<p>Even worse, most patients in former Soviet countries and across the world get practically no social support during the crisis. They get little help with side effects, and suffer serious social and economic strain. Many of them have no way to make up for lost wages over the course of their treatments. Some even face lasting discrimination. In 2011, <a href=\"http://dnews.donetsk.ua/2011/09/21/8967.html\">an undercover Ukrainian journalist</a> wrote an expos√© about being iced out by hiring managers after casually mentioning a past bout of TB.</p>\n<p>The reason why boils down to one key factor: Tuberculosis remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. In the former Soviet Union, people associate it with painful memories of the lawless, chaotic ‚Äò90s. Having it means you‚Äôre a crook, a junkie, a drunk, a bum, or a sewer rat.</p>\n<p>Stigma makes epidemics worse ‚Äî it gives people a reason not to be seen walking into a clearly labeled TB clinic to see a doctor when they should. Loneliness and despair can convince someone that health doesn‚Äôt matter, so why take these pills? And stigma shuts people up, so they‚Äôll never organize, influence funding, or change minds about TB. Stigma means more stigma.</p>\n<p>When patients are silenced and isolated from one another and their communities, it stymies progress against the disease. The WHO estimates more than a $1.3 billion worldwide <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/WHO_GF_TB_financing_factsheet.pdf\">funding gap in TB research and development</a>, and the number threatens to grow. Even though investment in new drug research is one obvious way to improve treatment, <a href=\"http://www.tbonline.info/media/uploads/documents/community_letter_to_astrazeneca_re_tb.pdf\">AstraZeneca</a>, Novartis, and Pfizer recently pulled a combined $50 million out of the fight. According to an email from the <a href=\"http://www.treatmentactiongroup.org\">Treatment Action Group</a>, a TB and HIV advocacy nonprofit, this steep loss amounts to a full third of private-sector TB investment since 2011.</p>\n<p>Erasing stigma, combating TB‚Äôs chronic underfunding, and promoting new research and drug development are incredibly lofty goals. But similar barriers have been conquered before in diseases like breast cancer and HIV/AIDS, where passionate activism made incredible inroads in raising awareness and influencing policy. If former and current TB patients joined together, could they build the first real advocacy movement centered on patients?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042061\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1018px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042061','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Tuberculosis patients haven‚Äôt always felt so alone.</p>\n<p>After leaving Denver, I read <i>The Magic Mountain,</i> Thomas Mann‚Äôs sprawling 1924 classic novel about a Swiss sanatorium. I forced myself to finish it, but it‚Äôs the most boring book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs the story of a total wiener named Hans Castorp who goes on a trip to hang out in the Alps and visit his TB-stricken cousin. Then Hans ends up sticking around and living there for seven years even though he doesn‚Äôt really have tuberculosis, just so he can do stupid crap like spend 70 pages talking about the nature of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Ugh, I‚Äôm still so <i>mad</i> at him. But maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a tiny bit jealous. So what if he‚Äôs a fake person with fake tuberculosis? It would have been so nice to have someone to be sick with.</p>\n<p>Sanatoriums, like National Jewish and the one atop <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, bridged the gap between the mid-19th century and the 1940s discovery of streptomycin. With no cure in sight, the ill had long made do with an iffy array of treatment options. Some doctors stuffed people‚Äôs windpipes with vacuum contraptions to simulate lazy lung capillaries. Cottage industries of miracle cures gorged on ad space in periodicals, sandwiched among serial installments of now beloved classics. (If you liked <i>Great Expectations</i>, you‚Äôll love Daffy &amp; Son‚Äôs Natural Miracle Multi-Purpose Health Elixir! Available wherever fancy wool top hats and snuff boxes are sold!!!<i>)</i> But the White Plague seemed to beat them all.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis did have one semi-formidable opponent, though ‚Äî one hope that physicians agreed on. It wasn‚Äôt a cure; it wasn‚Äôt a given. The idea came from an <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">1840 pamphlet</a> written by Dr. George Bodington, a British family doctor who covered a large area by making his house calls on horseback. His essay was based on a simple observation: that consumptives in wide-open spaces fared better than those packed tightly in cities.</p>\n<p>But Dr. Bodington drew a further conclusion: It must have been the country air that healed them. Their bodies need pure, unsoiled air, shared with as few people as possible. Depending on the severity of their case, they might need months or years of it. In the disease‚Äôs final stages, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> finally chews through the lung tissue, resulting in the bloody cough that famously beckoned death (but, curiously, couldn‚Äôt stop the heroines of <i>Les Mis√©rables</i>, <i>La Boh√®me,</i> and <i>La Traviata</i> from singing). If combated early with the right dose of air, the process could drag to a halt.</p>\n<p>And where could patients find such magic air? The best stuff was nippy, clean, and thin. Way up high, where no one can spoil it with industrial factory smog. And so, for the next 100 years, sick city-dwellers left their crowded hubs by the thousands and set off for specialized tuberculosis hospitals in the mountains. These sanatoriums treated patients with Dr. Bodington‚Äôs ‚Äúrest cure‚Äù ‚Äî medical observation, a generous binge diet, and hours a day in rows of canopied outdoor beds. In <i>The</i> <i>Magic Mountain,</i> characters traveled to Switzerland from places like England, Italy, and Poland. For months or years at a time, consumptives at sanatoriums lived and breathed together far away from real life, in their own little communities up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Denver ‚Äî the Mile High City, full of its own magic mountains ‚Äî thus became America‚Äôs magnet for the dying who wanted to live. In the late 19th century, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_6024584\">nearly a third</a> of Colorado‚Äôs population suffered from tuberculosis, after journeying west for the air that might save them. At the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, they slept two by two, tucked into each of its dozens of bunk beds.</p>\n<p>By the time I showed up, the bunk beds were long gone. There were no pretty canopies or breezy napping patios. And all that oh-so-edifying ‚Äúvirgin air‚Äù stuff? Turned out to be bunk. The bump in survival rates among patients who spent all that time outdoors wasn‚Äôt because of the air; it was the sun. Vitamin D is good for the immune system. They could have gotten the same effect on the roof of a tenement house. Or by taking sunshine stuffed into Vitamin D pills, like I did, supplemented by the UV light in my hospital room. (In a 21st century American city, you don‚Äôt just let a case of active tuberculosis run around outside.) Other times, patients‚Äô health improved simply because sanatoriums gave them a badly needed break from lives of poverty and labor.</p>\n<p>Still, the sanatorium era continues to be considered a public health success. Not because sanatoriums ever did much to help ‚Äúlungers.‚Äù But because they kept them away from healthy people. By shooing contagious patients off to remote treatment complexes, Dr. Bodington had inadvertently pioneered the concept of infection control. Keeping sick people away from vulnerable populations seems so obvious now. But back then, would the idea of germs ‚Äî invisible, flying disease pods ‚Äî have sounded any less silly than magic air?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042063\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"363\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 315px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Tuberculosis treatment in 1942 </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">D.

My mom made the appointment. I didn‚Äôt really want to go; I‚Äôve never liked therapy.</p>\n<p>But I hated doing this to my mom. This wasn‚Äôt just my crisis; it was my family‚Äôs too. And it was harder on my mom than anyone. She‚Äôd just spent 10 days next to me on a cot in the Denver ICU after my first lung surgery went wrong. She‚Äôd held my hand when the stiff chest tube draining blood from my lungs made breathing hurt so badly I got tunnel vision. She‚Äôd lost so much weight and was thinner than I‚Äôd ever seen her. So when she kept insisting that I talk to someone, I figured I could force myself to muster an hour of sincerity. And if I didn‚Äôt like it, I could lie, quit, and just find my own answers in some book.</p>\n<p>I got to the office and we made our introductions. Then I broke the ice.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHas anyone ever told you that you look like Laura Linney?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>She paused. For too long.‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve actually never gotten that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve actually never gotten that.‚Äù</p>\n<p><i>BULLSHIT. She looks</i> exactly <i>like Laura Linney.</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúI spoke to your mother on the phone. She said you contracted tuberculosis while you were in the Peace Corps in Russia?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo, I was in Ukraine. But yes. I mean, it was the Far East. The Russian-speaking part.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd so you‚Äôre going through chemo now? How long is that?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWell, I was hospitalized in Denver and got the part of my lung removed with the TB on it last month. So now I‚Äôm on chemo. It‚Äôs the IV drip. None of the radiation stuff. And I never lost my hair. So I don‚Äôt know if it even counts. I have nine months of that, and a total of two years or so on everything else.‚Äù</p>\n<p><i>OK, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm uniquely hyperaware of Laura Linney or something. There‚Äôs no way I could be the first person to notice.</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶it goes away?‚Äù she asked.</p>\n<p><i>Wait, is she pissed? Why? It‚Äôs a compliment, right? Hold on. Does she just, like, hate Laura Linney?</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúKnock on wood. It can come back, hypothetically,‚Äù I recited. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they treat it so aggressively. They just want to make sure that it‚Äôs really, really dead. But they can‚Äôt, like, promise you anything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I went back once or twice for additional sessions. I tried to explain that I wasn‚Äôt scared about dying or anything. By then, doctors seemed confident that I wouldn‚Äôt. But I had this anxiety I couldn‚Äôt shake. I wanted closure in Ukraine, and the people in my town. I wanted to be moving toward something. I tried to convert the emotional fallout into a momentum that more closely resembled psychosis. I took 36 practice LSATs but was hospitalized the day of the test. But panic was a problem I couldn‚Äôt obsess my way out of. I‚Äôd pick up a book but just hold it in my lap and forget what the hell it was for. I had no job and no idea what to do with myself. I lived with my parents, who at that moment seemed to be trying to keep me alive by never letting me out of their sight. I felt timid and stuck. I felt cheated out of that rosy immortality my friends had. All those toxic meds made me feel like someone else. I was very, very tired. And I felt like I was failing. I wanted my sense of control back. I was so damn sad.</p>\n<p>My mom picked that therapist because she specializes in treating patients with life-interrupting illnesses, like MS or cancer.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt can be hard for people to lose their control,‚Äù the therapist told me. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something I suggest that people can do to feel like they have some power over everything. Next time you go for an infusion, try to close your eyes and think of the chemicals in the drugs coursing through you, attacking all of the bad cells. And concentrate on them, and <i>really</i> see them. Then, envision the chemo forcing them out of your body. Picture them floating away.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I skipped my next appointment and never rescheduled. It wasn‚Äôt a therapist that I wanted. I wanted to connect with other patients like me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042069\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1289\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1241px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042069','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not the only person to conclude that TB patients may be uniquely equipped to help each other. In 1907, a Boston-area internist named Dr. Joseph Pratt had the same idea while searching for innovative treatment alternatives for TB patients who couldn‚Äôt afford faraway sanatoriums. He had the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2112765\">hippy-dippy idea</a> that bringing patients together could replicate the revitalizing effects of places like the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, and help patients heal. Couldn‚Äôt they guide each other through the experience better than any doctor could?</p>\n<p>Pratt tested his hunch with a trial of a dozen patients. Modern medicine‚Äôs first recorded support group was deemed a success. Moral support really did help combat tuberculosis. His destitute patients had made do without the magic air that wasn‚Äôt really magic and replaced it with something that was.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs one thing the sanatorium era got right that today‚Äôs TB control programs get wrong: the need for community. Today, the sanatorium era is thought of as a relic of medical quackery rendered moot by modern science. But to mock it in favor of enlightened antibiotic cures is to dismiss the lived experience of patients. For all their problems, sanatoriums were designed to heal patients. Today, treatment is primarily concerned with limiting threats posed to others. Patients‚Äô lives are collateral damage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042128\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"328\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 280px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042128','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I showed up at the radiology department of George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for my final chest X-ray in late spring of 2012. I stood in the yellow foot outlines and assumed the TSA body scan position without even waiting for the technician‚Äôs spiel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre an old pro, then!‚Äù he said from the processing room. ‚ÄúOK, deep breath and hold it‚Ä¶ Good‚Ä¶ Now let‚Äôs just make sure that‚Ä¶ <i>Whoa,</i> you‚Äôre missing a big part of your lung! Sorry, wasn‚Äôt expecting that!‚Äù That makes two of us.</p>\n<p>But the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> had indeed been destroyed. What was left of my lungs showed up as solid black ‚Äî just as a healthy X-ray is supposed to be.</p>\n<p>But somehow, it wasn‚Äôt as satisfying as I‚Äôd hoped. Once again, I wanted to share the moment with someone who understood what it meant. Moral support is nice for the good stuff too.</p>\n<p>I began to find out how many patients felt the same way in June 2013, when I finally went back to Ukraine. I made a ring around the country to gather data for my master‚Äôs thesis: I traveled to Kiev, Lviv, Crimea, Mariupol, Kharkhiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, and my beloved Antratsyt. I visited hospitals, clinics, and met doctors, health care and nonprofit workers, and, of course, patients. No matter who they were, tuberculosis had a profound impact on their lives. Many had lost friends or even family members over their illness, or felt forced to keep the experience secret. Loneliness and shame were practically the default.</p>\n<p>For as long as I‚Äôd spent surviving and learning about tuberculosis, one big question stuck in the back of my mind. I posed it to Oksana Viktorovna, a training coordinator for the <a href=\"http://stoptb.in.ua/en/\">Stop TB in Ukraine</a> initiative in Donetsk. Why, I asked her, is there so little communication and coordination within the TB patient community, and so much of it ‚Äî working successfully, by the way ‚Äî in other diseases?</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúPeople are ashamed to be associated with the fringe. And even though TB is curable, the stigma makes them think it would be better to have cancer.‚Äù And perhaps, she continued, people who survive TB are ready to forget it and move on.</p>\n<p>But, this might be changing, Oksana said. Lately, she‚Äôd noticed a few groups pop up online, on Russian networking sites like LiveJournal and VKontakte. Some people even created entirely new accounts to be able to discuss their lives with tuberculosis anonymously. ‚ÄúThey write about their experience, their worries, their questions,‚Äù Oksana told me. ‚ÄúIt seems to increase their optimism. I think it helps them get better.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The clandestine online TB clubs were easy to find. As soon as I started poking through them, I found someone my age from Khabarovsk, Russia, whom I felt like I already knew.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042124\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-wide-29875-1413500990-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"381\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 333px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Stigma shuts people up so they'll never organize, influence funding or change minds.

Even in the tourist-thick crowd by the famous Tretyakov Gallery, she wasn‚Äôt hard to spot. By now we‚Äôd already spent hours of our lives talking on Skype.</p>\n<p>Ksenia maintains a <a href=\"http://stoptub.livejournal.com\">patient-centered website</a> about TB, as well as pages in English and Russian across several social media platforms. Her project‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúBeing ill isn‚Äôt shameful,‚Äù challenges the negative cultural narratives about TB and the people who have it. Visitors can read the blog she kept during her treatment and her interviews with doctors and survivors. She regularly interacts with new patients from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Social media has the potential to finally address the long-standing need for support among TB patients. Last month, Doctors Without Borders <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/article/msf-study-highlights-potential-social-media-support-mdr-tb-patients\">published a study</a> that identified serious benefits for users of these online platforms, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msf.org/en/patients/blogs/tb-me\">TB &amp; Me</a>, the organization‚Äôs own blogging portal. Social media, <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0108591\">they conclude</a>, helps MDR patients adhere to treatment, gain back a sense of control, fight feelings of despair and solitude, and educate health care providers and the public. After treatment, survivors like Ksenia can continue to serve as mentors and advocates for the global patient community.</p>\n<p>I strolled with Ksenia across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, along the edge of Red Square, and up the fabled Arbat Street. We drifted between languages and talked about being sick.

Even as he ran for office in 2010, he faced criminal charges for <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">renting out apartments that were slummy and unsafe</a>. Midway through his first term, he was caught on tape taking $2.36 million in cash from an undercover agent he thought was a land developer. Co told the agent that for enough money he would vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù on any land-use plans. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the shittiest can of worms,‚Äù Co said.</a></p>\n<p>Despite Moreno Valley‚Äôs depressed property values, control over its land is actually worth a fortune. Indeed, nearly every major retailer in the world covets the kind of real estate the city offers: empty acres near freeways and train tracks at the epicenter of one of the largest but least noticed land rushes in America.</p>\n<p>This arid flatland, shimmering and indistinct in the heat and smog, is just perfect for warehouses. These are not, however, warehouses as most people think of them. These are massive, <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\">futuristic</a> behemoths that have proliferated on a scale seen nowhere else on the continent to usher in goods from Asia to consumers across a vast swath of the United States.</p>\n<p>Americans have grown to expect the goods they want delivered to their homes or nearby store shelves within days or hours. But all this two-day shipping, click-to-ship, and get-it-on-your-doorstep-by-noon-tomorrow has come at a price, paid by the people who live in the shadows of the mega-warehouses: lung-stunting, cancer-causing pollution and, in some cases, political corruption.</p>\n<p>The underside of our consumer economy can be seen in a tale of two cities, just 20 miles apart. There is Moreno Valley, where developers have shoveled in money to win the political approvals to build new warehouses. And there is Mira Loma, a tiny community already awash in warehouses and suffering some of the worst pollution in America.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúEveryone wants a new flat-screen TV,‚Äù said Ed Avol, a professor at the University of Southern California‚Äôs Keck School of Medicine who has spent the last two decades studying the effects of air pollution on children. ‚ÄúEveryone wants new clothing.

Thousands upon thousands of them, passing through in a ceaseless tide, creating a dull background roar, and contributing to some of the worst pollution in America.</p>\n<p>Although air quality overall in Southern California has improved in the last two decades, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the area has had among the nation‚Äôs worst ozone pollution almost every single year since 1988 and the worst fine-particulate-matter pollution in Southern California since the agency began measurements in 1999.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031008\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 847px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4031008','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The well-defined line between the residential neighborhood of Mira Loma (right) and the massive warehouse structures in the area (left). </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Emily Berl for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The community that epitomizes the pollution warehouses can bring is Mira Loma.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOur quality of life is in the tubes,‚Äù said Gene Proctor, 73, who has lived in Mira Loma Village for 43 years. ‚ÄúI wish people shopping in Tucson, Arizona, in other places, I wish they could see the little kids around here, their respiratory problems.‚Äù His great-granddaughter has asthma, and his 3-year-old great-grandson, he said, ‚Äúcoughs like a smoker.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4032789\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 369px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4032789','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Mira Loma Village, shown in green, is almost completely surrounded by warehouses. </span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Population 21,000, Mira Loma is so small and poor it doesn‚Äôt have a movie theater, a community center, or even a moderately upscale restaurant. What it does have are 90 warehouses and a whole lot of big rigs: <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-seeks-join-suit-protect-public-health-mira-loma\">Trucks rumble through 15,000 times <i>every day</i></a>. In just half an hour on a recent afternoon, 269 trucks passed by the big plate glass window in the front of the Farmer Boys truck stop on Etiwanda Avenue.</p>\n<p>That is more than one every seven seconds.</p>\n<p>Avol, the professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, began visiting the town in the early 1990s as part of a study of air pollution and children‚Äôs health across Southern California. Back then, he said, researchers chose Mira Loma because it sits at the ‚Äúend of the tailpipe‚Äù of the Los Angeles basin, meaning the prevailing winds off the Pacific Ocean blow L.A.‚Äôs infamous smog east until much of it arrives in Mira Loma. So it was rural yet had a lot of ozone and smog. Other places in the study, such as Santa Barbara and Long Beach, were picked because they were thought to boast clean air or because they were in industrial areas.</p>\n<p>When the study began, Mira Loma residents complained to researchers about the smell of dairy cows, herds of which clustered on vast pastures and cow yards. But in 1987, Riverside county supervisors revamped the general plan for Mira Loma, clearing the way for massive warehouse development.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn the course of a few years, the dairies disappeared,‚Äù and what had been ‚Äúopen pasture became streets and warehouses, lined with trucks,‚Äù Avol said. ‚ÄúMira Loma turned out to be a very interesting place to study.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The trucks made the already bad air worse, bringing in diesel particulates, very small particles that can enter the lungs and travel to tissues throughout the body. They are associated with asthma, heart disease, neurological problems, and cancer.</p>\n<p>In Mira Loma, children were found to be growing up with stunted lungs compared with children living in places with better air. Their lungs were growing at a rate that was 1 to 1.5% slower, Avol said, so that ‚Äúafter their teen years, they were about 10 to 12% lower in lung function than children who had grown up in cleaner places.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He added: ‚ÄúWe have no information at this point that supports the idea that they ever catch up.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Studies from other Inland Empire communities are also dire. In a neighborhood near the BNSF rail yard in the city of San Bernardino, Loma Linda University researchers <a href=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/clean-air-plans/clean-communities-plan/enrrich-final-presentation-6-24-14.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">found</a> that adults have more respiratory problems, and children alarmingly high rates of asthma, even when compared with other polluted communities.</p>\n<p>Warehouse industry officials, along with Barry Wallerstein, the head of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, insist that it is possible to build jumbo warehouses that do not pose a threat to public health. The key, Wallerstein said, is taking steps such as requiring that ‚Äúclean‚Äù trucks service them and ensuring that traffic going in and out does not abut residential areas.</p>\n<p>And yet, time and again, records and interviews show, officials failed to consider health impacts when approving warehouses.</p>\n<p>A 2002 investigation by the <i>Riverside Press Enterprise</i>, the local paper, examined the dozens of warehouses approved to be built in Mira Loma between 1987 and 2000. County planners <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/air-750218-county-pollution.html?page=1\">couldn‚Äôt point to a single one</a> in which they had required a detailed environmental study.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the county said it has ‚Äúimproved environmental protection,‚Äù and indeed as lawsuits from environmentalists and disconcerting health studies have piled up, officials across the Inland Empire have been ordering environmental reviews. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they turn down developers‚Äô requests for more warehouses.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Riverside County officials voted to allow a 1-million-plus-square-foot complex on one of the last pieces of vacant land near Mira Loma Village despite a study that found it would pose health risks to the people living there.</p>\n<p>A local environmental group, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, sued. California Attorney General Kamala Harris <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n256_mira_loma_proposed_complaint_in_intervention.pdf?\">joined the suit</a> on the side of environmentalists.</p>\n<p>The two sides <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-settlement-protect-public-health\">reached a settlement last</a> year that allowed development to proceed but required local officials and the developer to make the project ‚Äúgreener,‚Äù with electric vehicle charging stations and even a potential prohibition on trucks on the road closest to the village.</p>\n<p>The settlement also contained a provision that feels ripped from the pages of dystopian fiction: Every home in the village would be offered high-tech air filters so residents could avoid breathing the polluted air right outside their windows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031743\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"978\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 930px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4031743','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Lillyana Carrasco is pictured here with her father, Daniel Carrasco, as she leans on a new air filter at their family‚Äôs home in Mira Loma, California, on July 12.

Just one-fifth of adults over age 25 have a bachelor‚Äôs degree. When people are desperate for jobs, thousands of trucks driving through their community every day seems more tolerable.</p>\n<p>Then there is the money: Warehouse developers and the retailers that buy or lease from them have it. When they come in, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\"></a>they bring <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\">tax revenues to cash-starved local governments</a>.</p>\n<p>And developers donate to the political campaigns of politicians who control land-use approvals. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">Unlike the bribe Councilman Co took</a>, much if not most of the money surely flows through legal channels in the form of campaign contributions. But it‚Äôs hard to find an elected official in the Inland Empire who hasn‚Äôt benefited significantly, and in some cases overwhelmingly, from development interests.</p>\n<p>That was certainly the case in Moreno Valley. Population 200,000, the exurb sits 65 miles from Los Angeles. At the eastern edge of town, houses peter out into a dusty brown expanse, stretching to the horizon.</p>\n<p>The flat land, right by a freeway, is the site of developer Iddo Beneevi‚Äôs audacious plan to build what may well be the nation‚Äôs largest warehouse complex, a 41-million-square-foot colossus equivalent to 700 football fields called <a href=\"http://theworldlogisticscenter.com/multimedia/\">The World Logistics Center</a>.</p>\n<p>Long before the undercover FBI operative bribed Councilman Co (and then arrested him), Benzeevi methodically bought land ‚Äî the city estimates he owns or controls about half the developable land in town ‚Äî and helped build a political machine in this city.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi, as he will tell just about anyone who asks and even some who don‚Äôt, believes that ‚Äúthe logistics industry‚Äù is the inevitable next step in the evolution of human economic development, the end of a line of progress that leads from agrarian society to the great colonial empires to Apple, which, he claimed, can be seen as just a really cool logistics company.</p>\n<p>So far, he acknowledged, Moreno Valley has not been a hotbed of economic innovation. But with his help, he insisted, the city can put itself at the center of world commerce.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi has an exquisitely courteous manner, even with those who disagree with him, and a fancier style of dress ‚Äî suits or pressed shirts ‚Äî than that favored by most who frequent Moreno Valley City Hall. His long-winded fervor on the benefits of the logistics economy is so well known it is something of a joke in town.</p>\n<p>But until fairly recently his focus, like that of so many other developers, was on high-end homes that would rise up from the dry scrub as they had in so many other Inland Empire communities before the housing crash.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Benzeevi, reportedly working with Florida-based developer Jules Trump (no relation to the Donald), won approvals for ‚ÄúAquabella,‚Äù an upscale community that would feature estates built around artificial lakes ‚Äî ‚Äúreal resort living, without the hotel,‚Äù Benzeevi <a href=\"http://www.builderonline.com/design/projects/boomerangst_o\">told</a> one publication.</p>\n<p>He even helped convince the Moreno Valley City Council to rename the part of the city that would include the Aquabella community to ‚ÄúRancho Belago‚Äù ‚Äî the fact that ‚ÄúBelago‚Äù is not a word in English, Spanish, Italian, or any other common language didn‚Äôt deter anyone, nor did one resident‚Äôs complaint that it sounded <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312211-press-enterprise-rancho-belgao.html\">‚Äúgoofy‚Äù and ‚Äúlike a casino from Las Vegas.‚Äù</a></p>\n<p>Rancho Belago signs were eventually put up all over the eastern end of town ‚Äî although they were modified slightly from the original design after the city of Beverly Hills complained that they looked an awful lot like their iconic town signs.

The housing market buckled and crashed, and around six years ago Benzeevi and Trump swiveled to warehouses.</p>\n<p>It is easy to understand why. Appetite for warehouse space in the Inland Empire is so voracious that it‚Äôs almost sure money ‚Äî if one can get the land-use approvals and permissions to build.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt takes forever to get it approved‚Äù in California, said Kim Snyder, president of the southwest region for San Francisco-based Prologis, one of the world‚Äôs largest developers of distribution centers. ‚ÄúAnd then sometimes you get sued twice along the way because of some environmental group that contends the wild bunnies won‚Äôt have a place to go, or the desert kangaroo or the burrowing owl or what have you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For a retailer that needs space quickly, embarking on such a tortuous approval process can make little sense.</p>\n<p>So, in contrast to much of the rest of the country, warehouses in the Inland Empire tend to be built on spec, meaning that land developers such as Benzeevi build them and then find companies to rent them ‚Äî which has never been easier because the <a href=\"http://ar2013.prologisweb.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312846-prologis2.html\">gap between supply and</a> demand has never been greater. In just the first eight months of this year, industry experts said, companies snapped up 15 million square feet of warehouse space.</p>\n<p>Basically, the business boils down to this: Get approval to build, then watch the profits roll in. Several industry experts estimate that profit margins are consistently in the high teens.</p>\n<p>In that context, a developer might like to have as much influence over the land use process as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033060\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1059\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1011px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033060','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Skechers factory store and warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

West posed the question as the shoe company Skechers‚Äô national distribution center, developed by Benzeevi, came before the council.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi said that he dumped money into the 2008 campaign because the town was ‚Äústagnating‚Äù and to counter ‚Äúmyths.‚Äù Residents, he said, had grown weary of West ‚Äúcashing in at City Hall while little if anything was happening in Moreno Valley, except for rising crime.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe participate in our American democratic process,‚Äù he declared, and ‚Äúthe voters make the choices.‚Äù</p>\n<p>West lost the election. Those still on the council, he said, could hardly miss the point: ‚ÄúIf there wasn‚Äôt total compliance with Benzeevi‚Äôs plan, he had the resources to remove you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The Skechers warehouse was approved, and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href=\"http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=14626\">came to the 2010 groundbreaking</a>. The governor mused out loud that he wished Skechers would ‚Äúcreate some maybe alligator cowboy boot running shoes.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The warehouse, <a href=\"http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/community/news/news_13/031313skechers.html\">which city officials</a> touted as the largest certified green building of its kind in the United States, is more than half a mile long.</p>\n<p>In 2008 alone, campaign finance records show that one of Benzeevi‚Äôs companies, Highland Fairview, donated or loaned <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">more than $260,000</a> to local races that, for years before his arrival on the scene, had been won with far lower expenditures. Another big contributor was a land broker close to Benzeevi, Jerome Stephens, who kicked in more than $100,000.</p>\n<p>The men did not give their money directly to candidates. Instead, they donated it to a political action committee. In the close-knit ways of small-town politics, that committee had multiple connections to city power brokers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033571\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"423\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 375px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033571','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Councilman Richard Stewart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Macey J.

At one point, the law firm rented an office suite at Raceway.</p>\n<p>Things even got more entwined. In 2008, as the real estate market headed steeply down, the general manager of Raceway Ford, Tom Owings, sold his four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home with a pool and spa in the more upscale community of Redlands and moved into a rental house at the edge of the town in Moreno Valley.</p>\n<p>Less than two years later, he was appointed to the planning commission, and in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1314017-owings460-063012.html\">with the aid of campaign contributions</a> from Benzeevi‚Äôs ally Stephens, he was elected to the city council. He also received $10,000 from Skechers, which was later <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/press_release.php?pr_id=779\">fined</a> $2,400 by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for improperly failing to report that and other contributions.</p>\n<p>Owings told BuzzFeed News that he sought political office because he believed he could ‚Äúimprove the city‚Äôs financial position and make it a better place to live.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But moving from a grand home in Redlands to a rental in Moreno Valley was notable to some in town, because that is not the usual trajectory for those not in economic distress. And Owings appeared to be doing just fine. According to a <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/form700/2012/City/F-M/R_Owings_Thomas.pdf\">financial disclosure form</a> he filed covering the year 2012, Owings had various streams of income including a salary of more than $100,000 from Raceway Ford. He also held between $100,000 and $1 million in various investments.</p>\n<p>Owings said he changed his residence because his grandchildren, who had been living with him, moved away, and his house in Redlands was too big. He also wanted to sell it before the housing market crashed even further, he said, and Moreno Valley was closer to his office.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSnobbish‚Äù is how he described people who questioned his move. ‚ÄúPeople in Moreno Valley are like the people I grew up with, and I feel more comfortable in Moreno Valley,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Last year, Owings became mayor of Moreno Valley, a position that rotates among council members.</p>\n<p>The former car salesman, who looks a bit like an off-duty Santa Claus and is often seen in the company of his golden retriever Shiloh, quickly became known for his snappish temper and habit of berating people who disagreed with him.</p>\n<p>Owings said that he wasn‚Äôt beholden to Benzeevi and acted independently of him. But he was viewed as a staunch ally of Benzeevi‚Äôs, a perception that was fed not only by his voting record but also by statements attacking critics of the World Logistics Center.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033156\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033156','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Council meeting. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

Councilman Jesse Molina, who had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">received campaign donations</a> from the Benzeevi-funded political action committee<b>,</b> <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/city-644004-valley-moreno.html\">told the Chamber of Commerce</a> in 2012 that he had dreamed of the World Logistics Center his entire life. (Later, he said he meant that he dreamed of a vision for that part of town.)</p>\n<p>Co, the councilman caught on camera taking money from the FBI, was also often supportive of Benzeevi, although in private he could be less than complimentary about development projects to which he intended to give his vote. During a taped conversation with the undercover FBI agent in the spring of 2012, he confided that he had promised a developer ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html#document/p32/a178655\">he would always vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô on the developer‚Äôs projects even if it was a ‚Äòpissing can.‚Äô‚Äù</a> The federal affidavit does not identify the developer.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi himself said the humungous World Logistics Center represents a chance for Moreno Valley to escape poverty and the long commutes so many residents must make because there are so few jobs in town.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMoreno Valley has a historic opportunity,‚Äù he said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Life for many of its citizens, he said, is difficult, buffeted by low-paying jobs, endless hours on the freeway, and a choice between making ends meet and paying proper attention to children who must be left alone for hours on end while their parents commute.</p>\n<p>The World Logistics Center, he said, would solve many of those problems. He projects it would create 20,000 permanent jobs and another 13,000 construction jobs, and that it would be the largest ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù development in the United States.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, top city officials had been pressuring staff to push through approvals for Benzeevi‚Äôs projects, even though some of his plans violated the city‚Äôs building code procedures, according <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312216-earlycase.html#document/p10/a182306\">to a lawsuit</a> filed last year by three former city staffers.</p>\n<p>Those employees claimed they were also under pressure to go easy on a criminal code enforcement case the city had filed against Councilman Co before he won office. His properties had multiple troubles. For example, he rented out an illegally converted garage to not one, but two families with children. After <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">a child was injured in that</a> garage in 2010, building inspectors found a host of problems including dangerous wiring and substandard construction. The lawyer in charge of his defense in the code enforcement case was none other than Geller, the treasurer for the Benzeevi-backed political action committee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033361\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033361','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A construction site in Moreno Valley. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

(Benzeevi told BuzzFeed News ‚Äúwe have been working diligently‚Äù to improve the project, and ‚Äújudgment should be reserved‚Äù until the final environmental review.)</p>\n<p>Some were also angry that the Skechers project, which backers had said <a href=\"http://highlandfairviewbusinesspark.com/index.html\">could create 2,500 new jobs</a>, in fact employed only about 600 ‚Äî and many of those were people who had been relocated from the company‚Äôs old warehouse in a neighboring city.</p>\n<p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\"><i>Robotics Business Review</i></a> hailed the Skechers warehouse as being at ‚Äúthe vanguard‚Äù in using new technologies that rely on robots and automation instead of workers for much of the labor within its smooth, white walls. The article noted that the new technologies allowed the company to cut its staffing by nearly 75%.</p>\n<p>Asked about those figures and other matters, Lauren Dutko, public relations manager for the company said in an email: ‚ÄúSkechers has no comment for the story.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Benzeevi called complaints about the number of jobs at Skechers ‚Äúanother attempt to disparage us based on lies and misrepresentations.‚Äù He said there were 1,000 jobs projected at the Skechers warehouse and 2,500 in total at the development, which includes two approved but not-yet-built offices.</p>\n<p>Around the Inland Empire, some have also begun to question the quality of warehouse jobs. Inland Empire economist John Husing, a consultant to local governments and businesses, said <a href=\"http://www.laedc.org/sclc/documents/GM_Husing-whitepaper.pdf\">research shows that</a> the median <a href=\"http://www.johnhusing.com/QER%20Reports/QER%20Oct%202013%20web.pdf\">income</a> in the industry is nearly $44,000 ‚Äî one of the few routes to the middle class in the region for those without a college degree. Many warehouse developers and municipal economic development officials agree with that assessment. But some researchers argue that this rosy analysis <a href=\"http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/WarehouseWorkerPay_web.pdf\">doesn‚Äôt include</a> contractors and temp workers, who make up a large portion of warehouse workers. Advocates maintain that many of these jobs <a href=\"http://www.policymatters.ucr.edu/pmatters-vol5-2-warehouse.pdf\">are low-paid and unsafe</a>, trapping workers in poverty with little chance of advancement, or running them ragged until they get injured.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033762\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1071\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1023px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033762','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Iddo Benzeevi outside the Skechers factory store and warehouse. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Jolie Myers</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This was the context, when, in April of last year, boosters and bashers of Benzeevi‚Äôs World Logistics Center once again hustled into the gleaming Moreno Valley City Council chambers.

The prosecution said she should have called 911.</p>\n<p>Collin Grant‚Äôs case illuminates what domestic violence advocates say is a different problem: the collateral damage to the children of mothers sent away to prison for years.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat are we really doing on behalf of that child who is the victim of the crime?‚Äù said Deborah D. Tucker, <a href=\"http://www.ncdsv.org/ncd_staff.html\">executive director</a> of the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. ‚ÄúHow is that‚Äù ‚Äî imprisoning the mother ‚Äî ‚Äúhelpful to them?‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buzzfeed-media/Images/2014/09/buzzfeednews_failuretoprotectlaws.pdf\">At least 29 states</a> have laws that explicitly criminalize parents‚Äô failure to protect their children from abuse. In addition, prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws against criminal negligence in the care of a child or placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>Only a handful of state laws provide specific defenses for parents who reasonably feared they would be harmed if they stepped in to stop child abuse.</p>\n<p>Many prosecutors defend the laws and the harsh sentences as sending a message that mothers must defend their children, even if their own safety is at risk. Domestic violence advocates counter that such sentences are unjust ‚Äî and a sign that the criminal justice system does not understand how battering victimizes women.</p>\n<p>Altogether, BuzzFeed News <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin#34hf7pb\">found 28 cases</a> in which mothers were sentenced to at least a decade in prison despite evidence they themselves were victims of their violent partners. Alishia Mackey was one of those mothers.

A former friend <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310957-former-friend-testimony.html#document/p2/a181339\">told the court</a> that Alishia had confided in her at the time that Jimmy Don was battering her. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310043-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt3.html#document/p1/a181323\">testified</a> that he saw his mom get beaten. She escaped once, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310044-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a180894\">he told the court</a>, but Jimmy Don ‚Äútracked us down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One night, Alishia woke up <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180897\">to find she was alone in bed</a>. She got up and went to her son‚Äôs bedroom. What exactly she saw is unclear. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p2/a180905\">testified</a> that Jimmy Don was molesting him, and Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310106-police-testimony-excerpt1.html#document/p1/a180900\">first told police</a> that she saw Jimmy Don on top of Collin with both of their pants down. But in court, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180899\">she</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p1/a180906\">Collin</a> testified that he and Jimmy Don were both clothed.</p>\n<p>On the stand, Alishia changed many parts of her story and contradicted herself. ‚ÄúShe was her own worst enemy,‚Äù David Pierce, the prosecutor, said in an interview.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not uncommon. In its investigation, BuzzFeed News found that many battered mothers lie and take other actions that make them look guilty. The terror they feel sometimes lasts even after their partner has been arrested. Then too, repeated trauma, like PTSD, can harm a person‚Äôs mental health. ‚ÄúThere are many times when victims don‚Äôt put their best foot forward for a host of reasons ‚Äî including their own sense of guilt and failure,‚Äù Tucker said.</p>\n<p>Alishia also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310101-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a180904\">testified</a> that she suffered from petit mal seizures that led her to have a faulty memory.</p>\n<p>At trial, prosecutors alleged that the moment when Alishia walked in on her husband and her son came two years before authorities learned of it. Police pointed to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a181201\">an interrogation</a> in which she allegedly said the incident happened <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p3/a181202\">in January of 2002</a>, but officers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310730-police-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a181200\">didn‚Äôt tape that interview</a>. Collin testified that it happened in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310103-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a4\">fall</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310735-collin-testimony-excerpt-10.html#document/p1/a181204\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310736-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p2/a181208\">2003</a>, which would mean that the abuse came to light within a few months of her seeing it.</p>\n<p>Whatever the details, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310739-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a181210\">argued</a> that Alishia failed to protect her son by neither leaving the relationship nor going immediately to the authorities. On the stand, Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310738-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a181209\">estimated</a> that Jimmy Don molested him ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù five more times after his mother first learned of the abuse and before Jimmy Don was arrested.</p>\n<p>Pierce, the prosecutor, declared in court that Collin wanted his mother put away. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd like to see her spend the rest of her life in prison,‚Äù Pierce <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310176-prosecutor-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180922\">told the judge</a>. Asked about this, Collin told BuzzFeed News he was on psychotropic medication at the time of the trial and, because he was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310758-judge-agrees-to-screen-off-collin-from-his.html#document/p1/a181214\">screened off</a> from his mother during his testimony, did not realize he was testifying at her trial. He said he thought he was at his stepfather‚Äôs trial.</p>\n<p>One thing that Pierce never disputed was the fact that Jimmy Don had violently abused Alishia. Indeed, Pierce cited his battering of Alishia as evidence of her poor decision-making. ‚ÄúShe made the decision to stay,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303314-alisha-mackey-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178175\">he told the jury</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310163-alisha-mackey-jury-decision.html#document/p1/a180910\">Jurors found Alishia guilty</a> and recommended 20 years in prison. Alishia‚Äôs attorney, Corrine O‚ÄôDay, protested that the prosecution had sought only 15 years when Jimmy Don pled guilty to raping Collin. ‚ÄúThe state is not fully consistent,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310105-mackey-attorney-sentencing-argument-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180909\">she said</a>. But the judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310175-judge-determines-mackey-sentence.html#document/p1/a180920\">went with the jury‚Äôs recommendation</a>.</p>\n<p>Told that Collin recently said his mother should not be in prison, Pierce said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised with that at all. It‚Äôs his mother.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But that does not change Pierce‚Äôs view on Alishia‚Äôs sentence. ‚ÄúI believe that that was an appropriate punishment for what she did,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Don‚Äôs case was handled by a different prosecutor, Sejin Brooks. Now an attorney in Austin, Texas, Brooks said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äù that it might look strange that Alishia, who was convicted of permitting abuse, got a harsher punishment than Jimmy Don, who actually raped Collin. But, Brooks said, Alishia did not plead guilty but instead went to trial, risking the wrath of a judge and jury.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3469656_3973011\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"660\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 612px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3469656_3973011','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Visitors leave the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in McLoud, Oklahoma. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Sue Ogrocki / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The courthouse would be the last place Collin saw his mother for more than five years, until he turned 18.

Chance <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p91/a176125\">knew the couple had gone through trouble in the past</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p70/a176120\">something seemed off</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p73/a176131\">between them</a> now ‚Äî it just wasn‚Äôt clear what. Then Turner stepped outside and dragged Titches <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p73/a176132\">into the living room</a>. Titches <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p74/a176141\">had soiled</a> his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p86/a176139\">light-blue</a> pajama pants.</p>\n<p>Turner, a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p92/a176233\">6-foot-2-inch, 220-pound</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p196/a176234\">factory worker</a>, ordered the toddler <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p74/a176235\">to bend over and touch his toes</a>. He whipped him with a thick leather belt, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p74/a176235\">then threw him against the wall</a>. Titches hit his head so hard that he spat out some of his breakfast. Turner took Titches <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p75/a176237\">by his neck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p75/a176236\">wiped his face in the half-eaten cereal</a>. With Titches on his back and crying, Turner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p76/a176238\">pressed his foot to the boy‚Äôs chest</a>. Then he picked him up, dragged him to the bathroom, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p76/a176239\">pushed his face into the toilet, and flushed</a>.</p>\n<p>Turner turned to Lindley, warning her that if she tried to take Titches out of the house <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p91/a176242\">he would kill her</a>. Chance <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305248-source-note-1.html\">could see</a> the terror on Lindley‚Äôs face. Yet Lindley spotted an opening, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p80/a176244\">grabbed</a> hold <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p38/a176256\">of her son</a>, and made for the front door.</p>\n<p>She was too slow. Turner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p80/a176244\">snatched the boy from her arms</a> and, still holding the boy, slammed the door shut on Lindley and Chance, locking them outside. Stunned, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p80/a176244\">they withdrew to figure out what to do</a>.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day, Titches <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p107/a176262\">would be dead</a>, and Turner would be <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305249-source-note-2.html\">arrested</a> for his murder. Prosecutors would charge Turner with assaulting Lindley too, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283058-turner-family-violence-assault-case-file.html#document/p7/a176269\">noting that she was ‚Äúvery afraid‚Äù of him</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet they would also deem Lindley a criminal. Even though Lindley had tried to rescue her son, they would <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284219-lindley-clerks-record.html#document/p11/a176323\">prosecute her for failing to protect him from Turner</a>.</p>\n<p>Her sentence: <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p221/a176283\">45 years</a> in <a href=\"http://offender.tdcj.state.tx.us/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=07601887\">prison</a>.</p>\n<p>Lindley‚Äôs case exposes what <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305753-source-note-6.html\">many battered women‚Äôs advocates</a> say is a grotesque injustice. As is common in families terrorized by a violent man, there were two victims in the Lindley-Turner home: mother and child. Both Lindley and Titches had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p162/a178185\">suffered beatings</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305254-source-note-4.html\">for months</a>. But in all but a handful of states, laws allow for one of the victims ‚Äî the battered mother ‚Äî to be treated as a perpetrator, guilty not of committing abuse herself but of failing to protect her children from her violent partner.</p>\n<p>Said Stephanie Avalon, <a href=\"http://conferences.bwjp.org/webconferencedetail.aspx?confid=345\">resource specialist</a> for the federally funded <a href=\"http://www.bwjp.org/\">Battered Women‚Äôs Justice Project</a>, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ultimate blaming of the victim.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3453834_3872948\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-25459-1411510572-17.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-25459-1411510572-17.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"981\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 933px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3872948','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-25459-1411510572-17.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Photographs of Titches Lindley sitting above his bed at the home of his father, William Wade, in Dallas. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Melanie Buford for The Dallas Morning News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>No one knows how many women have suffered a fate like Lindley‚Äôs, but looking back over the past decade, BuzzFeed News identified 28 mothers in 11 states sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for failing to prevent their partners from harming their children. In every one of these cases, there was evidence the mother herself had been battered by the man.</p>\n<p>Almost half, 13 mothers, were given 20 years or more. In one case, the mother was given <a href=\"http://offender.tdcj.state.tx.us/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=06961419\">a life sentence</a> for failing to protect her son, <a href=\"http://offender.tdcj.state.tx.us/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=05130766\">just like</a> the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284220-tx-james-johnson-rose-gaines-case.html\">man who murdered the infant boy</a>.

In Texas, where Lindley lives, the crime is known as injury to a child ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284219-lindley-clerks-record.html#document/p11/a176323\">by omission</a>.‚Äù In other states, it goes by ‚Äú<a href=\"http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2903.15\">permitting child abuse</a>‚Äù or ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455672\">enabling child abuse</a>.‚Äù In addition, prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws against criminal negligence in the care of a child, or placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>These laws make parents responsible for what they did <i>not</i> do. Typically, people cannot be prosecuted for failing to thwart a murder; they had to have actually helped carry it out. But child abuse is an exception, and the logic behind these laws is simple: Parents and caregivers bear a solemn duty to protect their children.</p>\n<p>If a violent partner threatened her child, ‚ÄúI would sacrifice my life 10 times out of 10,‚Äù said Carmen White, the <a href=\"https://www.dallasda.com/info/leadership/carmen-p-white/\">Dallas prosecutor</a> ‚Äî and mother ‚Äî who pressed charges against Lindley. The law <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p220/a176746\">provides justice</a> for child victims, she said, and it <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p219/a176737\">sends a message</a> to mothers about their duties.</p>\n<p>Only a few states provide an exception for parents who feared for their safety at the time the violence occurred. In some of these states, that exception is narrow or limited, leaving battered women open to prosecution.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284226-oh-michelle-mooty-appeal.html#document/p8/a176530\">often</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284225-neena-costanza-guilty-plea-transcript-of-04-10-14.html#document/p17/a176528\">use</a> the violence a mother endured as evidence against her. Since she was battered, they sometimes argue, she should have left the relationship, taking herself and her child to safety.</p>\n<p>Advocates have tried but failed to compile national figures on how many women get prosecuted and sentenced under these laws. BuzzFeed News <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">created its tally</a> by focusing on 29 states that allow for sentences of at least 10 years. But because of limitations in the data provided by different states, BuzzFeed News‚Äô tally is conservative; the actual number of cases is likely higher.</p>\n<p>Then there are cases of women sentenced to a decade or more but where it‚Äôs difficult to determine whether they were victims of partner violence. BuzzFeed News found 45 such cases over the last decade. Often, the abuser and the mother who didn‚Äôt stop the abuse pled guilty, leaving little detail in their court files about what actually happened. Domestic violence advocates suspect many of these women were battered too, saying that women who‚Äôve suffered abuse often conceal it, even through weeks or months of counseling. ‚ÄúI know in my heart that there‚Äôs more out there,‚Äù said Laurel Mohan, executive director at the Battered Women‚Äôs Legal Advocacy Project in Minnesota.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">(BuzzFeed News‚Äô methodology and full list of cases can be found here.)</a></p>\n<p>Where there is evidence of the women being battered, the case files describe them being <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305255-source-note-5.html\">punched</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305303-charity-bailey-appeal.html#document/p3/a178881\">throttled</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305307-rose-gaines-james-johnson-case-document.html#document/p2/a178888\">kicked</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305320-victoria-pedraza-testifies-that-she-was-whipped.html#document/p1/a178892\">whipped</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305312-victoria-pedraza-says-she-was-forced-to-have-sex.html\">raped</a> ‚Äî often in combination ‚Äî at or around the time their assailants were doing the same to their children. ‚ÄúMy husband took full possession of me and my life,‚Äù a mother in Tennessee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1302172-tn-penselynn-loyola.html#document/p14/a177598\">told the court</a> right before her 15-year sentence was handed down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305756-source-note-11.html\">Domestic violence advocates</a> say these cases signal a deep misunderstanding of what it means for women to be trapped in abusive relationships. Many such women fear alerting authorities, because doing so can provoke their partners to extreme violence. Moreover, authorities often fail to protect battered women and their children. Advocates also say that imprisoning these women serves little purpose and deprives any surviving children of their mother.</p>\n<p>The laws against failing to prevent child abuse are written to cover both fathers and mothers. And, in fact, women perpetrate 34% of serious or fatal cases of physical abuse of children, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304804-screen-shot-of-nis-4-study.html#document/p1/a178700\">according to</a> the latest <a href=\"https://www.nis4.org/access_nis4.html\">congressionally mandated national study of child abuse</a>. But interviews and BuzzFeed News‚Äô analysis of cases show that fathers rarely face prosecution for failing to stop their partners from harming their children. Overwhelmingly, women bear the weight of these laws.</p>\n<p>BuzzFeed News <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">found</a> a total of 73 cases of mothers who, regardless of whether they were battered, were sentenced to 10 years or more. For fathers, BuzzFeed News found only four cases.</p>\n<p>White, Lindley‚Äôs prosecutor, couldn‚Äôt recall prosecuting any fathers for failure to protect from physical abuse.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMothers are held to a very different standard,‚Äù said Kris McDaniel-Miccio, a law professor at the University of Denver whose expertise is domestic violence. She said that the lopsided application of these laws reflects deeply ingrained social norms that women should sacrifice themselves for their children.</p>\n<p>From a different perspective, White agreed, saying that severe punishments generally fit ‚Äúwhat people believe‚Äù should happen to mothers who shirk their duty to their children.</p>\n<p>Aside from conceptions of motherhood, McDaniel-Miccio said that many people ‚Äî and, by extension, many judges and juries ‚Äî still don‚Äôt grasp the answer to a question at the core of so many of these cases: Why didn‚Äôt she leave him?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3453834_3894780\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/30/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-23958-1412110393-1.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/30/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-23958-1412110393-1.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"791\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 743px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3894780','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/30/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-23958-1412110393-1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_link  buzz_superlist_item_wide  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3453834_3935150\" rel:buzz_num=\"27\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_link c\">\n        <p class=\"sub_buzz_numbered hidden \">27.</p>\n\t\t<span class=\"sub_buzz_link_sign\">LINK</span>\n        <div>\n            <p>\n                <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buzzfeed-media/Images/2014/09/buzzfeednews_failuretoprotectlaws.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">For a complete breakdown of state laws, click here.</a>\n            </p>\n            <p class=\"sub_buzz_link_url\">s3.amazonaws.com</p>\n            <div class=\"sub_buzz_description\">\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n</div>\n        </div>\n\t</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Shortly before Alonzo Turner and Arlena Lindley began dating, a young woman named Michaelyn Haynes and her sister were sleeping, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p57/a176394\">they told police</a>, when they awoke to a noise and found Turner in the kitchen.

When she refused, he grabbed her by the neck and cupped her mouth with his hand, forcing her out of the house.</p>\n<p>A neighbor, Mark Page, overheard the ensuing struggle and demanded that he let her go. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p59/a176406\">He told police</a> that Turner replied, ‚ÄúStay the fuck back or I‚Äôll kill her.‚Äù Page pulled a Taurus .38 Special revolver and fired a warning shot into the ground. But Turner still did not back down, continuing instead to threaten to kill Haynes. Page didn‚Äôt want to shoot, so he pulled out a knife and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p59/a176407\">stabbed Turner in the leg</a>. Only then did Turner flee.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Haynes said that even now, with Turner safely behind bars and their relationship long over, she has trouble trusting people. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still scared to this day,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Police records first <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p59/a176408\">refer to Turner‚Äôs actions as ‚Äúaggravated kidnapping,‚Äù</a> a <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.20.htm\">felony</a>. Ultimately, however, he was charged with <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283059-turner-unlawful-restraint-case-file.html#document/p4/a176418\">‚Äúunlawful restraint,‚Äù</a> a <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.20.htm\">misdemeanor</a>. The police report states that the incident was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p59/a176421\">not a family violence issue</a>.</p>\n<p>Both the burglary and unlawful restraint charges took months to wind their separate ways through the system. Two weeks before he killed Titches, Turner was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286246-turner-burglary-case.html#document/p4/a176821\">found guilty of burglary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286246-turner-burglary-case.html#document/p2/a176823\">sentenced to probation</a>. He never stood trial for the unlawful restraint charge, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283059-turner-unlawful-restraint-case-file.html#document/p1/a176425\">which prosecutors dropped once he pled guilty to murder</a>. Turner declined to be interviewed for this story.</p>\n<p>He and Lindley started dating in early 2006, when he was 18 and she was 20. He seemed sweet, Lindley said in an interview. Sitting in the prison cafeteria, supervised by a guard, she recounted the course of their eight-month relationship, which is also covered in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p159\">court documents</a>.</p>\n<p>Early on, he took her to restaurants and the local go-kart track, and he bought toy cars for Titches. When he found out that Lindley‚Äôs ex had called her, he demanded that she tell him that she never again wanted to speak to him. But he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p162/a178185\">didn‚Äôt hit her</a> for the first few months they were together.</p>\n<p>By the time they were both arrested, however, he had punched her, pulled her hair, and sat on her. ‚ÄúHe choked me all the time,‚Äù she said, once so hard that he lifted her off the ground. Turner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305520-source-note-26.html\">weighed 50 pounds more</a> than Lindley, who is 5 feet 4 inches and wears glasses. One time she tried to call the police on him, but he grabbed hold of her by the hair and hurled her outside.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe would say he would never hit me in the face, because he gotta look at me,‚Äù Lindley said, but anything else seemed in bounds. Turner didn‚Äôt even care if other people saw. He once shoved her down at a parking lot outside a laundromat, the gravel stinging her palms as she broke her fall.</p>\n<p>Another time, they were in the apartment, and Turner had some friends over. Turner owned a gun, and Lindley was nervous about it being in the home with Titches around, so she took out <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p190/a178713\">a bullet</a> and threw it outside into the dark. Turner found out and ordered her to comb the grass until she found it. One of his friends offered her a flashlight, but Turner refused to let her use it. When she failed to find it, he ordered her to strip naked and continue searching on her hands and knees.</p>\n<p>Lindley grew more and more afraid of Turner. ‚ÄúHe just snaps,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p162/a178185\">she said in court</a>. ‚ÄúYou never know how he is going to be when he wakes up in the morning.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One evening, after he used a belt on Titches, Turner fell asleep. Lindley quickly packed her bags and got ready to usher Titches out the door. Turner‚Äôs young nephew was in the home, though, and asked where they were going. She told him they were going to the store. He asked to come with her, but she said no and set off walking in the direction of a friend‚Äôs place. They hadn‚Äôt gotten more than a few hundred feet when Turner caught up to her. He forced Titches from her arms, gave him to the nephew, and, clutching Lindley by the shirt, pulled her back toward the apartment.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI done tried to leave plenty of times,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p164/a178712\">she testified</a>, but he ‚Äúactually called and threatened to kill my family.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The last time Lindley tried to escape, she hitchhiked to the home of a friend, who then gave her a ride to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p190/a178714\">her father‚Äôs house</a>. She didn‚Äôt hear from Turner for a couple of days. Then he called her cell phone, saying that if she was truly leaving him, he wanted back some stuff he had given her. He came by her father‚Äôs house, and she brought down a boom box he had bought her.</p>\n<p>As she turned to go back inside, he grabbed hold of her, threw her into the car trunk, and slammed it shut. <i>Today is the day I die</i>, Lindley recalled thinking.</p>\n<p>She lay in the darkness, waiting for his next move. After a few minutes, he popped the trunk back open, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306264-source-note-27.html\">telling her</a>, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt gonna do you like that‚Äã.‚Äù Lindley was terrified. But, she said, she also didn‚Äôt want to bring trouble into her father‚Äôs house. She moved back in with Turner.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3453834_3876818\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/16/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12821-1411763269-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/16/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12821-1411763269-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"519\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 471px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3876818','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/16/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12821-1411763269-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">From left: Arlena Lindley and Alonzo Turner. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Dallas County Sheriff's Department</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Texas lawmakers didn‚Äôt seem to have cases like Lindley‚Äôs in mind when, in 1977, <a href=\"http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/billSearch/text.cfm?legSession=65-0&amp;billtypeDetail=HB&amp;billNumberDetail=1089&amp;billSuffixDetail=&amp;startRow=1&amp;IDlist=&amp;unClicklist=&amp;number=100\">they created the state‚Äôs child abuse ‚Äúby omission‚Äù law</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305257-source-note-7.html\">During a brief committee hearing</a>, just one witness was called, a county prosecutor. Asked what kinds of situations the omission law would cover, he cited parents who fail to feed their children, causing them to starve. He did not mention a woman failing to stop her violent partner from abusing the child. The bill passed easily.</p>\n<p>Yet <a href=\"https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/747/747.F2d.278.84-1287.html\">prosecutors used the law against battered women as early as 1983</a>, when an El Paso man named Keith Webb <a href=\"https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/796/796.F2d.60.85-1617.html\">murdered</a> his 6-year-old stepson and buried him in the desert. It emerged that Keith had also been abusing his wife June for years. She had reported him to the police several times, but he was never prosecuted. June was convicted of child abuse by omission because<b>,</b> on two occasions after Keith hurt her son, including when he dropped the baby in scalding hot bathwater before his death, she didn‚Äôt seek medical help for the boy. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>\n<p>Other states‚Äô laws arose in different circumstances and at different times, but many came as part of a general trend, starting in the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/insights_law_society/ChildProtectionHistory.authcheckdam.pdf\">toward stricter child abuse statutes</a>.</p>\n<p>Domestic violence advocates began to organize on a national scale in the late 1970s. When lawmakers in <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/?doctype=Chapter&amp;year=1983&amp;type=0&amp;id=217\">Minnesota</a> and <a href=\"https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/iactc/71.1/CH0180.pdf\">Iowa</a> created failure-to-protect laws in the mid-1980s, they added specific defenses for parents who reasonably feared they would be harmed if they stepped in to stop child abuse.</p>\n<p>In the early ‚Äò90s, Texas also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286248-1993-texas-bill-report.html#document/p5/a176757\">added</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286253-texas-penal-code-chapter-22.html#document/p16/a176756\">such a defense</a> to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286253-texas-penal-code-chapter-22.html#document/p13/a176755\">its omission statute</a>, but it was a narrow one. It would not apply if the parent were aware of any child abuse prior to the incident in question ‚Äî a sharp contrast to Iowa, which <a href=\"http://coolice.legis.iowa.gov/cool-ice/default.asp?category=billinfo&amp;service=iowacode&amp;ga=83&amp;input=726.6\">extends its defense</a> to parents aware of ‚Äúcontinuing abuse.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even as understanding of domestic violence grew, and as prosecutors built up a track record of using omission laws, some legislators still didn‚Äôt envision battered women being prosecuted under such laws. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305330-oklahoma-hb-2037-creating-enabling-child-abuse.html#document/p1/a178896\">In 2000</a>, Oklahoma state Rep. Jari Askins <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305264-source-note-8.html\">authored</a> a bill that created the crime of ‚Äúenabling child abuse,‚Äù with the word ‚Äúenabling‚Äù meant to drive home that a failure to act was enough to warrant prosecution.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Askins said that she has paid keen attention to domestic abuse against women throughout her career, going back to when she was a judge in the 1980s, when there was no specific crime for assaulting a spouse or partner. As a legislator, she helped <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284224-oklahoma-1996.html\">pass a law</a> stiffening penalties <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?citeid=444865\">for committing a domestic assault in front of children</a>.</p>\n<p>But during the creation of the ‚Äúenabling child abuse‚Äù law, the prospect that it might help imprison battered women wasn‚Äôt on the radar, Askins said. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt thinking about domestic violence.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Askins said she is sympathetic to mothers in those situations, and she thinks it‚Äôs an important mitigating circumstance. But she doesn‚Äôt think protections need to be built into the law. She made a point that White, Lindley‚Äôs prosecutor, also made: Defense lawyers can raise that sort of evidence in court, and judges and juries can consider it as they weigh guilt or innocence and decide on punishment.</p>\n<p>But often, it‚Äôs prosecutors who deploy the fact that the woman was battered. Some point to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303315-victoria-pedraza-raw-transcript4.html#document/p1/a178176\">failed</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p190/a178177\">attempts</a> to leave the abusive partner as proof that the mother wasn‚Äôt completely helpless and could have done more to save her child. Others cite contact <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284225-neena-costanza-guilty-plea-transcript-of-04-10-14.html#document/p17\">with police</a> or <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284226-oh-michelle-mooty-appeal.html#document/p8/a176530\">social service workers</a> about domestic violence prior to the child‚Äôs injury as missed opportunities to disclose more about the danger posed to the child. Many, in one way or another, present the man‚Äôs violence as a testament to the mother‚Äôs poor decision-making.</p>\n<p>In his opening statement in the trial of an Oklahoma mother accused of enabling child abuse, the prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303314-alisha-mackey-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178175\">told the court</a> that the man had also abused the mother. But, the prosecutor said, ‚ÄúShe made the decision to stay.‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303314-alisha-mackey-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178174\">He added</a>, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about putting your child at risk because of the choices you make, and the choices you make to stay in an abusive relationship.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Whatever Askins and her fellow lawmakers intended, Oklahoma prosecutors have used the law vigorously. Of the states BuzzFeed News examined, Oklahoma had the most women imprisoned for a decade or more: 20 overall, including four cases in which BuzzFeed News found evidence that the imprisoned mother had been battered. In Ohio, with three times the population, BuzzFeed News found a total of just three cases.</p>\n<p>In fact, the likelihood that a woman will get a severe sentence depends largely on where she lives. In Minnesota the maximum sentence for permitting child abuse is one year. In <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455672\">Oklahoma</a> the sentence can be life. And then, even within a state, it is individual prosecutors who decide whether to press charges and how aggressively to do so.</p>\n<p>In one of the only cases that ever captured the national spotlight, prosecutors actually changed their minds. Twenty-seven years ago, 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/20/nyregion/report-faults-school-in-case-of-slain-girl.html\">was found comatose with brutal injuries in a fetid Manhattan apartment</a>. Her mother, a 45-year-old children‚Äôs book author named Hedda Nussbaum, initially faced murder charges alongside her husband, attorney Joel Steinberg, who would eventually be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/31/nyregion/steinberg-is-guilty-of-first-degree-manslaughter.html\">found guilty</a> of manslaughter.</p>\n<p>But it quickly emerged that Steinberg had battered both wife and daughter: At the time of her arrest, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/01/nyregion/for-nussbaum-journey-to-understanding-is-slow.html\">Nussbaum had a broken nose, fractured ribs, and a potentially life-threatening ulcer</a>. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/18/nyregion/steinberg-jury-will-consider-all-four-charges-of-homicide.html\">Prosecutors dropped the murder charge against her</a>. But whether Nussbaum deserved to go to prison became the subject of fierce national debate in the press ‚Äî especially after she admitted at Steinberg‚Äôs trial that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/nyregion/in-person-hedda-nussbaum-starting-over.html\">both of them used cocaine heavily</a>, and that she had <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19881201&amp;id=wnlPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jlEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6597,5949584\">an 11-hour window</a> between Lisa‚Äôs final beating and her death yet did not call the police. In the end, prosecutors did not charge her with ‚Äúendangering the welfare of a child,‚Äù <a href=\"http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0260.10_260.10.html\">a misdemeanor in New York</a> with <a href=\"https://www.omh.ny.gov/omhweb/forensic/manual/html/chapter1.htm\">a maximum penalty of one year in prison</a>.</p>\n<p>In Oklahoma, ‚Äúenabling child abuse‚Äù <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455672\">carries the same sentence as actually committing it</a>. Askins told BuzzFeed News that when her law passed, her only focus was protecting society‚Äôs most defenseless. Many issues have shades of gray, she said, but child abuse is not one of them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll protect the child at all costs.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3453834_3877111\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/12/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19851-1411750368-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/12/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19851-1411750368-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"764\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 716px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3877111','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/12/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19851-1411750368-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>With the door slammed shut and Titches trapped inside with Turner, Chance and Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p80/a176257\">drove off to find a pay phone</a>. Chance <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p81/a176532\">wanted Lindley to call 911</a>. But Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p160/a176533\">worried that might set Turner off further</a>, putting Titches in more danger.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúShe was so scared of him,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305265-source-note-9.html\">Chance said</a>.</p>\n<p>Lindley later testified that her top priority was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p160/a176533\">to calm her boyfriend down</a>. Then with the situation under control, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p181/a176535\">she and Titches could escape</a> when <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p166/a176536\">he left for work</a>. So instead of calling 911, Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p173/a176538\">called Turner</a>, eventually negotiating <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p176/a176542\">a return to the apartment</a> a few hours later.</p>\n<p>What Lindley and Chance did not know is that while they were gone, Turner had more in store for Titches. The apartment manager, who had seen Lindley and Chance leave, could still hear Turner yelling, so she peered through a window into the apartment. She saw Titches on the floor. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p101/a176543\">Turner kicked him in the stomach, repeatedly</a>.</p>\n<p>By the time Lindley and Chance came back to the apartment, Turner <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p177/a176545\">seemed to have calmed down</a>, somewhat. Titches was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p79/a176549\">dressed in fresh clothes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p176/a176544\">with a Band-Aid on his temple</a>. Turner had bought some Pepto-Bismol, saying Titches‚Äô <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p177/a176546\">stomach was hurting</a>. But Turner began forcing the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p179/a176547\">tired child</a> to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p77/a176550\">walk from the dining room table to the television, back and forth, again and again</a>. Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p201/a176553\">begged him to let Titches lie down</a> for a nap, and finally <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p181/a176554\">he relented</a>.</p>\n<p>He then <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p181/a176556\">ordered Lindley to go to the grocery store</a>. Not wanting to reignite his fury, she agreed.

Then he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p184/a176560\">stopped breathing</a>.</p>\n<p>When the paramedics arrived, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p186/a176561\">Turner ordered Lindley not to ride in the ambulance with her son.</a> Eventually, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p186/a176562\">a police officer drove her to the hospital</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p60/a176564\">Titches was dead</a>.</p>\n<p>A Dallas police detective walked Lindley, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p60/a176566\">still crying</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p60/a176565\">to an empty room</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p61/a176567\">handed her a sheet of paper to write out what happened</a>. Later, Lindley made a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p29/a176569\">fuller statement to a different officer</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p34/a176570\">The apartment manager gave her account too</a>.</p>\n<p>Turner was arrested <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305265-source-note-2.html\">that evening</a> and charged with <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p98/a176572\">capital murder</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p98/a176573\">The police report noted ‚Äúno priors for family violence.‚Äù</a> Prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283058-turner-family-violence-assault-case-file.html#document/p3\">added a domestic assault charge</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283058-turner-family-violence-assault-case-file.html#document/p7/a176269\">hitting Lindley when she tried to stop him from beating Titches</a> and for <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283058-turner-family-violence-assault-case-file.html#document/p10/a176574\">shoving her to the ground</a>.</p>\n<p>Lindley told BuzzFeed News that as she went about mourning her son, she had no inkling that she was a suspect herself.

But <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305755-source-note-3.html\">many domestic violence researchers and advocates</a> see the same behavior as evidence of just how victimized the women have become. The women‚Äôs decisions, they say, follow the logic of fear: Battered mothers are trying to manage the rage of their partners and avoid a more severe attack. ‚ÄúAnytime I interfered,‚Äù Victoria would later <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303297-victoria-pedraza-sentencing-testimony-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178155\">tell the court</a>, ‚Äúit would just make the situation worse.‚Äù</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs more, victims of domestic violence often suffer ongoing trauma, meaning that the brain does not have time to recover the way it does from a one-off traumatic event, said Amy Bonomi, chair of the Human Development and Family Studies Department at Michigan State University. She was the lead author of <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284234-bonomi-archives-final.html\">a 2009 study in the <i>Archives of Internal Medicine</i></a> that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284234-bonomi-archives-final.html#document/p5/a176595\">compared women who had been victims of partner violence within the past year with women who had never suffered domestic abuse</a>. Victims <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284234-bonomi-archives-final.html#document/p5/a176594\">were more than three times as likely to have depression and almost six times as likely to abuse drugs or alcohol</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3453834_3874173\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/longform-12395-1411493230-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/longform-12395-1411493230-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"400\" height=\"460\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 317px; top: 412px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3874173','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/13/enhanced/webdr08/longform-12395-1411493230-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Victoria Pedraza and her daughter.

Three nights before Aubriana died, Daniel decided she should not be allowed to sleep and ordered her to stay standing up through the night. He awoke to find the little girl sitting down, so he tied the green cord around her waist, draped it around the closet rod, and attached it to his wrist. If she sat down again, the tug on his arm would wake him up.</p>\n<p>He ended up beating both of them <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p633/a178162\">with a belt and his fists</a>, hitting <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p576/a176604\">the little girl in the stomach</a> so hard that it caused her <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p663/a3\">internal organs to rupture</a>. When Aubriana took her last breath, Victoria <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p624/a176592\">began CPR</a> and begged Daniel to call 911. ‚ÄúAnd tell them what, Vicky?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p610/a176589\">she remembered him saying</a>.

Deen <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305287-source-note-23.html\">concluded</a> that Victoria had not abused her daughter. He agreed to drop the capital murder charge, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p609/a176602\">as long as Victoria testified truthfully against Daniel</a> ‚Äî and if she pled guilty to ‚Äúpermitting child abuse,‚Äù a felony in Arkansas <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p609/a176603\">that warrants between five and twenty years in prison</a>.</p>\n<p>Daniel also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p576/a176604\">pled guilty</a>, in his case <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p576/a176605\">to first-degree murder</a>. (In a jailhouse interview, Daniel told BuzzFeed News that despite his guilty plea, he was innocent of murder and that he never abused Victoria.) At his sentencing hearing, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p609/a176606\">Victoria‚Äôs testimony</a> helped put Daniel away <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p757/a176607\">on a life sentence</a>. At her own sentencing hearing, she took the stand and told essentially the same story. But this time Deen‚Äôs prosecuting team cross-examined her.</p>\n<p>On the evening of the fatal abuse, Victoria <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303300-victoria-pedraza-case-abstract-and-brief2.html#document/p70/a178167\">had gone to Walmart</a> after Daniel had already punched her daughter in the stomach at least twice. Deen‚Äôs deputy asked why she didn‚Äôt get the police involved then.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was scared to death of Daniel,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303308-victoria-pedraza-raw-transcript-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178169\">Victoria answered</a>. ‚ÄúI felt that if I interfered in a way, like, to call law enforcement, it would make things worse. Of course he probably would have went to jail. He probably would have got bonded out and he was coming right back. That‚Äôs the fear I had.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat about Aubriana‚Äôs safety?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303308-victoria-pedraza-raw-transcript-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178170\">the prosecutor asked</a>.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI feared that, too, yes.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In his closing argument, Deen‚Äôs deputy pinned her on her early lies to the police. Victoria <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303310-victoria-pedraza-raw-transcript3.html#document/p1/a178172\">had said</a> she didn‚Äôt begin to open up until she was in jail because that was the first time she didn‚Äôt have to fear how Daniel might react. The prosecutor disagreed. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt that she felt safe,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303309-victoria-pedraza-raw-transcript-excerpt2.html#document/p1/a178171\">he said</a>. ‚ÄúIt was that she was caught.‚Äù In rebuttal, Victoria‚Äôs attorney asked for mercy, <a href=\"http://searktoday.com/aubrianas-father-satisfied-with-pedraza-sentence/\">brandishing pictures</a> of the bruises jail officials found on Victoria when they booked her.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3453834_3877176\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-4626-1411510845-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-4626-1411510845-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"274\" height=\"283\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 191px; top: 235px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3877176','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/23/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-4626-1411510845-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Arkansas Department of Correction</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Victoria‚Äôs jury <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303298-victoria-pedraza-sentencing-excerpt-jury.html#document/p1/a178159\">took less time to deliberate</a> than <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1284229-daniel-pedraza-brief-abstract-of-record.html#document/p756/a176609\">Daniel‚Äôs had</a>.

The failure to make that call, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p48/a176613\">police</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p215/a176612\">prosecutors</a> said, was a key part of her crime of omission.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a176615\">But somebody else called 911</a>, a fact that was not mentioned during Lindley‚Äôs case in court.</p>\n<p>After the apartment manager had peered through the window and seen Turner kicking Titches, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305268-source-note-12.html\">she had a colleague call the police</a>. The call came in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a176615\">at 10:53 a.m.</a> ‚Äî around the time when Lindley and Chance would have been trying to figure out what to do.</p>\n<p>An officer was sent to the scene. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a176616\">He entered the apartment and found no one</a>. An upstairs neighbor said that Turner had taken the toddler and fled. Whether the officer or anyone else at the Dallas Police Department did anything in the ensuing hours is unclear. The police report, obtained through a Public Information Act request, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a177681\">classifies the incident as ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù</a> ‚Äî not as the more urgent <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p59/a177682\">‚Äúoffense,‚Äù</a> which warrants an immediate criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPlease route to CPS,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a176618\">the report says</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p103/a176619\">referring to Child Protective Services</a>. It notes that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p7/a176617\">the location and condition of the victim is unknown</a>, and does not indicate any further attempt to track down Turner or Titches. Dallas police declined to comment on the case. The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services declined to comment on whether it received a report from the police and on whether it took any action that day, and it rejected a public records request for documents on Titches‚Äô death.</p>\n<p>Paul Johnson, Lindley‚Äôs court-appointed attorney, didn‚Äôt respond to a written question asking why he didn‚Äôt raise the 911 call in court. In an earlier interview, he had said that he couldn‚Äôt recall the specifics of Lindley‚Äôs case and that he no longer had access to any of the case documents.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286242-dallas-pd-afternoon-call.html\">Police were called again at 2:13 p.m.</a>, according to the next report provided through the public records request. By then, Titches had stopped breathing.</p>\n<p>The day of Titches‚Äô death was not the first time police responded to a call about his welfare. A few months earlier, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305245-dallas-morning-news-story-november-4-2006.html#document/p2/a178826\">a relative</a> alerted authorities after <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p5/a176620\">she noticed bruises on his back</a>. A detective visited the apartment and found Turner, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p5/a176621\">who said that neither Lindley nor her son were home</a>. Turner told the officer that Lindley‚Äôs family <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p5/a176622\">had been making false claims</a> about the child.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p139/a176649\">Titches‚Äô father</a>, William Wade, had also caught wind that something was going on. He would later testify that he also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p141/a176623\">called Child Protective Services</a>, and that <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p142/a176624\">he was told a caseworker had checked on Titches and found nothing wrong</a>. He also called the police, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p142/a179218\">he told the court</a>, but had no luck there either.</p>\n<p>Around that time, Wade called Lindley himself and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p143/a176627\">asked her directly whether Titches was getting hurt</a> and if he could come and check on their son, to make sure. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p150/a176625\">Wade could hear a lot of commotion in the background, he testified</a>. It sounded like a male voice ‚Äúhollering and screaming.‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p151/a176626\">Then came what sounded like tussling.</a> Then the line went dead. Turner, it seemed, had snatched away the phone.</p>\n<p>Wade did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.</p>\n<p>(Wade‚Äôs mother, Cathy Lee, has created <a href=\"http://www.titcheslindleyfoundation.org/\">a foundation in Titches‚Äô name</a>. <a href=\"http://window.state.tx.us/taxinfo/exempt/exempt_search.html\">State</a> and <a href=\"http://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/mainSearch.do;jsessionid=n8LbMyUv3VpH7ZerW6l41A__?mainSearchChoice=pub78&amp;dispatchMethod=selectSearch\">federal</a> records indicate the foundation is not registered as tax-exempt.

The reason, prosecutor White told BuzzFeed News, is that he did not know for sure that Titches was being abused, and did not witness the abuse on the day the boy died.</p>\n<p>Chance also was not charged with the omission crime ‚Äî and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p216/a176735\">couldn‚Äôt be</a> <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm\">because she wasn‚Äôt Titches‚Äô parent or caregiver</a>.</p>\n<p>Unable to afford bond, Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p159/a176652\">stayed in jail for 15 months</a> as she awaited the resolution of her case. She was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1305269-source-note-13.html\">willing to testify</a> against Turner, but that wasn‚Äôt necessary ‚Äî he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1302172-tn-penselynn-loyola.html#document/p14/a177598\">pled guilty</a> to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1286247-turner-murder-case.html#document/p16/a176818\">murder</a> in exchange for a life sentence <a href=\"http://offender.tdcj.state.tx.us/OffenderSearch/offenderDetail.action?sid=07675762\">with the possibility of parole</a>.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors offered a plea deal to Lindley, too: <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p7/a176653\">10 years in prison</a>.</p>\n<p>Johnson, Lindley‚Äôs attorney, decided he could do better, though not by winning her an acquittal. He decided on an ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p5/a176654\">open plea</a>,‚Äù where she would admit guilt on the omission charge and make her case for mercy in court. She had powerful points in her favor: <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p139/a176655\">Titches‚Äô father</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p120/a176656\">paternal grandmother</a> were <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p3/a176657\">willing to testify in her defense</a>, despite the fact that Lindley‚Äôs relationship with Turner had led to the boy‚Äôs death.

It would be unfair to my son, knowing that he [is] in a better place right now, to sit up and try to badger her and say that she was just a terrible mother toward my son.‚Äù</p>\n<p>When Lindley herself took the stand, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p163/a176721\">she said</a> she thought she was ‚Äúdoing the right thing‚Äù in trying to wait out Turner‚Äôs rage. ‚ÄúI actually thought if I would do what he say,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúhe would calm down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then Judge Howard turned to Lindley and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p199/a176727\">asked her</a> whether Titches was crying that morning, before she and Chance left the house. Lindley <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p200/a176728\">said yes</a>.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd you just sat there?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p200/a176730\">the judge asked</a>.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lindley replied. ‚ÄúI tried to help my son.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo, I tried. I didn‚Äôt sit there. I tried to make him stop.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat attempts did you make? What did you do?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI yelled at him so he would get the attention off Titches, and that‚Äôs when he came at me.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd what was Titches doing then?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe was crying.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd was he still crying when you left the house with Latricia?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶ I was trying to get my son. I don‚Äôt remember. Because I had him. He snatched him back. I don‚Äôt remember.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In closing arguments, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p215/a176731\">reiterated his plea for mercy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p213/a176733\">said</a>, ‚ÄúWhat I have got beside me is another victim of Alonzo Turner.‚Äù</p>\n<p>White, the prosecutor, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p219/a178206\">countered that</a> the judge needed to make a statement that a mother should ‚Äústep up‚Äù and at the very least call the police or paramedics. A mother, she said, is supposed to ‚Äúlay her life, if she has to, on the line for her child.‚Äù She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p219/a176738\">reminded the judge</a> of the state‚Äôs plea deal offer of 10 years. ‚ÄúWe believe that the court will make the appropriate decision,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p219/a176739\">White said</a>, ‚Äúon the amount of time she spends in prison.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then Judge Howard handed down the 45-year sentence. ‚ÄúLike the prosecutor said, this is the last justice for Titches,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1277580-lindley-sentencing-transcript.html#document/p221/a176281\">she stated</a>. ‚ÄúThe evidence showed me you were more worried about yourself than your child on October 13th, 2006. You failed to protect him from that horrible beast you were living with. You had a duty to protect your son, and you let him down. You didn‚Äôt nurture him when he needed you the most.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3453834_3895881\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/12/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-25944-1411749256-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 552px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3453834_3895881','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/12/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-25944-1411749256-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Texas Department of Correction</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Years later, White recalled that she was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù when Judge Howard went far beyond the 10-year sentence she had offered. Still, White said she feels that 45 years is plenty fair. Lindley, she said, watched Turner ‚Äútorture‚Äù her only son, ‚Äúand then she got in her car with her friend to get hair products.‚Äù White said, ‚ÄúShe deserved what she got.‚Äù</p>\n<p>White did not initially remember that her office had viewed Lindley as a victim, having charged Turner with assaulting her on the day he killed Titches. She acknowledged that many see child abuse and domestic violence as linked, and she said that in many of the cases she sees, the perpetrator has committed both. But, she said, she runs the child abuse division of the Dallas County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, and a separate division handles domestic violence. ‚ÄúWhy women stay, and that ‚Äî I can‚Äôt speak to that; I have no expertise in that,‚Äù she said. Her division focuses on ‚Äúonly the children.‚Äù</p>\n<p>White also did not recall that someone else called 911 when Lindley hadn‚Äôt, but White said that fact didn‚Äôt mitigate her sense of Lindley‚Äôs guilt. (Judge Howard declined to be interviewed and did not respond to a written question about the 911 call.) A call from a mother would have carried more weight than one from a neighbor, White said, and the fact that someone else phoned didn‚Äôt relieve Lindley of her duty as a mother to take action. ‚ÄúIn the end,‚Äù White said, ‚Äúshe walked out alive, and he didn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Lindley stays in <a href=\"http://tdcj.state.tx.us/unit_directory/hb.html\">an all-women‚Äôs prison</a> off a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/State+of+Texas:+Hobby+Unit/@31.255312,-96.910471,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4016cf9d451b35f0\">stretch of farmland halfway between Austin and Dallas</a>.

The parole board cited its ‚Äúnature of offense‚Äù rule, reserved for prisoners whose acts were too egregious for them to be granted clemency.</p>\n<p>Told that many people believe that in a situation like hers, they would do anything to protect their children from abuse, she said, ‚ÄúI was like that. ‚ÄòOh, it couldn‚Äôt be me.‚Äô But you really don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Titches <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1283055-arlena-lindley-dallas-pd-records.html#document/p99/a176745\">would be 11 years old now</a>.

Madewell was back, somehow, but she wasn‚Äôt sure exactly how or why. I wandered inside the store. It was all women‚Äôs clothing ‚Äî expensive women‚Äôs clothing. I found a clerk and said, in some jumbled, excited, confused way, that this was my shop, that Madewell was my family‚Äôs business. I think she thought I was angling for a discount. After politely and professionally feigning interest while I struggled to explain a history I didn‚Äôt even really know, the clerk stopped me. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sell men‚Äôs clothes,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Over the next four years, I saw Madewell everywhere. Today there are three stores in Manhattan alone, and 77 throughout the country. On bags on the subway, on tags of clothes worn by friends, I am constantly bombarded with totems of my family history.</p>\n<p>Asking my family yielded the basics: Madewell as it stands today began in 2004. That‚Äôs when Millard ‚ÄúMickey‚Äù Drexler, now the CEO of J.Crew, acquired the logo and the trademark of the company my great-grandfather founded in 1937. Dhani Mau, a senior editor at <i>Fashionista</i>, said, ‚ÄúJ.Crew considers it their younger sister brand,‚Äù though she said it‚Äôs not necessarily for younger sisters. Pressed to pick out a celebrity who might typify the Madewell girl, Mau chose Kate Bosworth and Rachel Bilson. This does not entirely jibe with my mental picture of my tough immigrant great-grandfather selling stiff denim overalls to New England dockworkers.</p>\n<p>Still, Madewell will not let you forget the date 1937. The store could originally be found online at madewell1937.com, and the year is prominent on the site and on some of the clothing. The company‚Äôs Instagram and Twitter handles are both still @Madewell1937, and its LinkedIn page says, ‚ÄúMadewell was started in 1937 as a workwear company, and we‚Äôre always looking to the brand‚Äôs roots for inspiration.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This is, to put it mildly, baloney. Madewell as it stands today has almost nothing at all to do with the company founded by my great-grandfather almost 80 years ago. How many vintage labels out there have similar stories? How many corporations are out there rifling through the defunct brands of America‚Äôs past like a bin of used records, looking for something, anything, that will give them that soft Edison-bulb glow of authenticity?</p>\n<p>Madewell‚Äôs story ‚Äî my story ‚Äî leading up to that moment in SoHo began over a century ago, half a world away. It traces the evolution of how Americans shop, and how Americans shop heavily informs how Americans see themselves; we, as a country, are what we buy. Mickey Drexler, in creating J.Crew‚Äôs new womenswear stores, shrewdly read the market and realized that stocking nice clothes wouldn‚Äôt be enough: He‚Äôd have to tell a story along with them. Drexler didn‚Äôt have any stories, so he bought ours.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904183\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-9270-1411773163-17.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-9270-1411773163-17.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904183','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-9270-1411773163-17.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A view from the Madewell store in NYC‚Äôs Soho. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Flickr: Ludovic Bertron / Creative Commons (CC BY 2-0) / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/23912576@N05/3037790141/in/photolist-5Crtb6-edCxf7-8ZKkWy-edwRbM-edwUAe-edCxPw-edCzRh-edE4N9-3hR4Qf-m5KbCt-m5JJYx-m5K6CD-m5Kj7e-m5Jz42-m5Kx3p-m5JRHV-m5LiuG-m5K49F-m5KLhv-m5LaKU-m5JCmK-m5Lmaw-m5L8s7-53HCo7-bCV8DG-bQjK6a-bCV8NL\">Flickr: 23912576@N05</a></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Julius Kivowitz was born in Russia in 1889 or thereabouts.

The Beham family was fairly well-off and managed to secure a sponsor for Julius in the U.S., in a prosperous Massachusetts port city near Providence called New Bedford. There was only one problem: Any attempt by Julius to leave under his own name would have exposed him as a draft dodger. (Some in my family, including his youngest daughter, referred to him as a ‚Äúconscientious objector.‚Äù Whether he objected to war or merely his own participation in the war isn‚Äôt clear.) My cousin Judy told me that Julius invented his new last name by going to a cemetery and picking out the name of someone who, had he lived, would have been about the same age.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904226\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-26378-1411773345-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-26378-1411773345-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"385\" height=\"385\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 302px; top: 337px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904226','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-26378-1411773345-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A young Julius Kivowitz seated in the center. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Ellen Horvitz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It was a good time for a Jew to leave Europe. By 1906, pogroms ‚Äî huge, brutal, bloodthirsty, anti-Jewish riots ‚Äî were commonplace in the Russian Empire. Mobs of Russians burned and sacked entire Jewish towns, murdering men, women, and children, with the implicit permission or even participation of police. Many Jews fled, the newly renamed Julius Kivowitz and his fianc√©e, Fannie, among them. (It was somewhat scandalous and also a bit romantic that the two fled together before they were married.) He landed at Ellis Island at age 19, stayed in New York for a few years, moved north to Connecticut, and then went further eastward up the Atlantic coast to New Bedford.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_small image_lfrs  \" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904233\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-9137-1411773540-2.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-9137-1411773540-2.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"431\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 383px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904233','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-9137-1411773540-2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Fannie Kivowitz </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Ellen Horvitz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>When my great-grandfather arrived there some 90 years ago, New Bedford was just beginning the decline from its status as one of the country‚Äôs most bustling, wealthiest port cities. New Bedford had been the whaling capital of the world, one of the settings in Herman Melville‚Äôs <i>Moby-Dick</i>. Hundreds of huge, magnificent schooners and clipper ships were built and launched from its port. By 1850, thanks mostly to profits from whale oil, New Bedford was the wealthiest city per capita in the country. But the whale oil industry collapsed, and by the time the wave of immigrants that included my great-grandfather and his young family settled there in the 1920s, the town had pretty much abandoned whaling and turned to fishing and manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Julius, like so many of his generation of immigrant Eastern European Jews, was an entrepreneur with no particular passion besides financial success. First he opened a grocery store, earning enough money to, along with a partner from New York, move into textiles. It was a natural move for Julius, as it was for many other Jews, who brought a centuries-long tradition of textile manufacturing with them from Europe. Beginning around the 16th century in Eastern Europe, Russian and Polish Jews began working with wool. By the 1860s, heavily Jewish cities like Lodz and Bialystok were textile-manufacturing centers; more than half of the textile industry in Bialystock was Jewish-owned. This was pretty much stamped out by the 1930s, thanks to decades of violent anti-Semitism perpetrated by independent Poland. But Julius had already fled Eastern Europe and made his home in New Bedford.</p>\n<p>In 1936, Julius filed for the Madewell trademark, and in 1937 he opened his first factory. No one seems to know why he picked ‚Äî or if he himself even did pick ‚Äî that name.

The only one of Julius‚Äô children still living is my great-aunt Barbara, the youngest of the Kivowitz brood by nine years. Her husband, Aaron, ran the shipping department of Madewell, but didn‚Äôt come on until 1951. Nobody knows much about that mysterious New York partner who oversaw the factory floor but vanished from the company within a few decades. Nobody knows how many workers ‚Äî ‚Äústitchers,‚Äù they were called ‚Äî were employed at first. Nobody, to be frank, seems to know much about Julius. The documents I could find from that era give the date of the company‚Äôs founding but not much else; whatever records Madewell kept from its early years are gone. After questioning damn near everybody still alive who ever met him, here are the facts I gathered about my great-grandfather:</p>\n<p>1. He spoke mostly a mix of Yiddish, Russian, and English, with a thick accent.</p>\n<p>2. He was rarely seen without a cigar.</p>\n<p>3. He loved the card game pinochle, and played every week.</p>\n<p>4. He didn‚Äôt talk much, and I can find exactly no one who can recall him saying a single word about his childhood in Russia.</p>\n<p>5. He liked nice things. He built a big house and filled it with expensive appliances and Oriental rugs, which seems to have annoyed his wife Fannie, who did not care much for extravagance.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs it.</p>\n<p>His employees at the time likely included the dominant immigrant groups of New Bedford: Portuguese speakers largely from the Azores and Cape Verde, French Canadians, and possibly some Jews. The company at the onset was designed smartly and specifically to cater to the substantial working class of the community: It made jeans, dungarees (which differ from jeans in that the threads are pre-dyed before weaving), and bib overalls. These were hardy work clothes, intended for use inside the factories and fisheries of New England.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904384\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-11658-1411775431-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-11658-1411775431-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"693\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 645px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904384','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-11658-1411775431-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of the Nosowitz Family</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Madewell was a family operation.

Most of the clothes were contracted, made by any of several other factories and stamped with the Madewell name. Madewell had lots of partners at other factories ‚Äî one in Georgia, one in Kentucky, among others ‚Äî that would take care of the design and manufacturing. If Haskell or Jerry or Julius went to a local department store and saw that corduroy-lined denim jackets were selling well, they‚Äôd come back to the factory and tell one of the stitchers to make one. If the stitcher wasn‚Äôt sure how, they‚Äôd buy one of those jackets, tear it apart, and make a pattern out of it, then re-create it. Or if that seemed like too much trouble, they‚Äôd call one of their contacts at another factory, say, ‚ÄúMake us a corduroy-lined jacket,‚Äù stamp their logo on it, and sell that. Madewell‚Äôs logo didn‚Äôt necessarily indicate who physically created the garment, but simply who was selling it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do too much of that designing bullshit,‚Äù my great-uncle Aaron told me. Aaron is a warm, tough, stocky man whose crushing handshake hasn‚Äôt lessened in strength even as he ages into his eighties. As we talked at his kitchen table, looking out on wild turkeys strutting through his backyard in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, he would occasionally sing what I think is a line from ‚ÄúMemory,‚Äù from the musical <i>Cats</i>. ‚ÄúThe only stuff we did in-house was the rough stuff,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDenim, brown duck pants, carpenter stuff.‚Äù During Aaron‚Äôs tenure, there were only ever around 25 stitchers at Madewell who actually made clothes. I asked Aaron who designed that stuff. ‚ÄúYou copy somebody else‚Äôs!‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúCome on, ‚Äòdesign.‚Äô It was not a fancy place, Dan. No such thing as ‚Äòdesigning.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Aaron bristled when I asked if the Madewell clothes were high quality ‚Äî ‚ÄúOh, yes, they were very well made,‚Äù he said ‚Äî but these weren‚Äôt exactly pioneering designers crafting original clothing out of a deep passion. They weren‚Äôt inventors or artists. They looked at what was selling and made some of that to sell. It was a business, and Madewell did what made sense from a business perspective. J.Crew‚Äôs Madewell is grasping to emulate some sepia-hued commitment to quality in the original company, some moral or ethical standard from better, more authentic times. But that‚Äôs not what motivated my great-grandfather at all ‚Äî his motivation was profit, and quality was a means to an end.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904242\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-17805-1411776155-15.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"693\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 645px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904242','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-17805-1411776155-15.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Dan Nosowitz / BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>New Bedford is one of the last towns you pass through as you drive eastward out to Cape Cod, which hooks out from the East Coast like a flexed arm.

It would be uncharitable, but not inaccurate, to say that New Bedford is the armpit of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>Despite a cute, gentrified waterfront area and a few museums, the city is today one of the poorest and most dangerous in the state. Big brick factories, either barely used or totally vacant, are everywhere; the unemployment rate hovers above 10%. In the 1990s, the city attempted to rename the area the ‚ÄúSouth Coast,‚Äù because merely the name of New Bedford signifies decay, depression, and loss.</p>\n<p>And still, New Bedford looks like a port city in the way that only New England towns can. Trim three- and four-story houses, mostly in sea-weathered gray, line the streets. Every turn seemingly leads to the water, the smell of which is everywhere. Huge stone levees, looking like the organized results of avalanches, do their best to protect the city from the Atlantic‚Äôs wrath, and roads that cut through these levees are equipped with alarmingly heavy-duty iron gates, up to 20 feet high, that can close if water approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904520\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr09/longform-30927-1411777053-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"291\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 243px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904520','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr09/longform-30927-1411777053-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Vintage Madewell jeans at Circa Vintage </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Dan Nosowitz / BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Circa Vintage Wear on 73 Cove St. is airy and industrial, still chilly in the Massachusetts spring. The medium-size, mostly unmarked brick factory, just beside the ocean, smelled of old fabric and dust and wood shavings, a pleasant perfume that changes subtly as you move through the decades upon decades of vintage clothing and accessories. In one corner, a wall of nothing but circular hatboxes reached to the high ceiling. A twentysomething who would later buy a pair of shiny gold dress shoes examined an entire case of bow ties. Semi-broken old mannequins wearing everything from frilly white gowns to what looked like old high school marching band uniforms stood sentry in aisles of clothes from wildly disparate eras. In the racks, jammed up against what must have been dozens of other stories just as rich and as weird as mine, were a few pieces of original Madewell.</p>\n<p>There were heavy-duty jumpsuits, which must have dated from the 1940s or 1950s. There was a denim jacket with a striped, sweater-like lining and a corduroy collar. There was a pair of Dickies-like blue chino work pants. There was a pair of bell-bottoms from the 1970s that could have been made by Levi‚Äôs or Wrangler or lots of other big international brands ‚Äî but the bell-bottoms, the jumpsuits, the jacket, and the work pants all boasted that label, that great logo, that stopped me dead in my tracks in New York years before.</p>\n<p>Chris Duval opened Circa in 1986 and has been pretty much its sole employee ever since. Wearing a pale denim jacket and tough denim work pants, Duval is short and slender and speaks with a thick South Coast accent, which is somewhere between Boston and cartoon pirate, and all of his statements sound like they should end with an exclamation point. He told me that he likes to sit down with the people from whom he buys his wares and learn about the history of each piece.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen this whole thing came about with J.Crew, I was devastated,‚Äù he said, in the same tone that a fan of an indie band might have bemoaned signing to a major label in 1995. ‚ÄúWhen that happened, workwear was just coming back. So I thought, <i>Oh, cool, they‚Äôre gonna do a workwear line inspired by Madewell</i>. But it has nothing to do with that! It‚Äôs Chinese crap!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Duval found the way J.Crew touted its connection to the original Madewell especially galling. ‚ÄúYou go to the flagship store in New York and there‚Äôs a big thing about New Bedford and its heritage, and I‚Äôm like, <i>Oh, god, this is so sad!</i>‚Äù Duval told me that he liked to put pictures of his original Madewell goods on Instagram and taunt J.Crew about its ‚ÄúMadewell in name only‚Äù clothes. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre using the original brand to push something that has nothing to do with the original brand,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>I looked more closely at the flannel-lined denim jacket. It was cool, and vintage, and, being that my great-grandfather‚Äôs company made it, I‚Äôd have a great story behind it. I tried it on and immediately took it off. I looked like I was wearing a costume.

I almost envied his clear-cut offense at the company, but I was surprised to find that I didn‚Äôt really share it.</p>\n<p>The concept of authenticity in retail is a borderland where academics and marketers commingle. It is a philosophical chew toy that is also the key to fleecing consumers in new, exciting, and highly profitable ways. Jim Gilmore, the co-author (with B. Joseph Pine II) of <i>Authenticity: What Consumers Really Want</i>, knows this better than most. His book doesn‚Äôt so much offer tips to marketers as it examines what authenticity means in a retail space, and how customers react to it.</p>\n<p>According to Gilmore, the American consumer economy has moved through three distinct stages, from agrarian to industrial to service, to arrive at what he terms in his book the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù stage. To sell a product today, a company must also sell a story, a transformation. A new pickle company needing to differentiate itself can‚Äôt simply rely on people needing to eat (agrarian), or undercutting the competition on price (industrial) or convenience (service). The way to sell that jar of pickles is to tell consumers about how it‚Äôs an old-country recipe from the Romanian hills, using heirloom cucumbers grown upstate and fresh dill from the factory‚Äôs rooftop garden, and it was crafted only two miles from here in a facility that used to make No. 3 pencils.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe define authenticity,‚Äù Gilmore told me over the phone, ‚Äúas purchasing on the basis of conforming to self-image. ‚ÄòI like that, I am like that.‚Äô‚Äù Authenticity is about buying into a product that confirms what you already think, or want to think, about yourself. Of course things like quality and durability are all mixed up in that; the Romanian-Brooklyn pickles are, probably, pretty good, and the fact that the buyer wants to see himself as the type of person who buys cool weird pickles doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that the buyer may also recognize that the pickles are better than Claussen‚Äôs. In fact, that‚Äôs part of it: Self-awareness of the purchase is key to the purchase itself.</p>\n<p>In his job as a marketing consultant, Gilmore sometimes takes clients on tours of stores he deems worthy of emulation. He remembers when he first saw Madewell: ‚ÄúIt feels like a boutique store while surrounded by boutique stores in SoHo, but it‚Äôs not one,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúThe place has got integrity; it all holds together.‚Äù He praised the choice of materials and fixtures (‚Äúindustrial without being too raw,‚Äù he said). He also praised the choice to show a select line of clothes, with limited quantities of each. This is, of course, common in boutiques, which are able to produce only in smaller quantities for cost reasons. For Madewell, it‚Äôs an aesthetic choice. Madewell has 77 branches in the U.S. at the time of writing, including stores in the two largest malls in the country, the Mall of America in Minnesota and the King of Prussia Mall in suburban Philadelphia. Madewell doesn‚Äôt have any trouble stocking its shelves. It‚Äôs telling a story about itself, that it‚Äôs a small, lovingly curated boutique. This isn‚Äôt true at all, but the customers don‚Äôt much care. Madewell‚Äôs unlikely rebirth, however, began with a man who had no interest in blurring these lines.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3456197_3903858\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/22/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4403-1411785196-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1371\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1323px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3903858','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/22/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4403-1411785196-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Justine Zwiebel / BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúI had always been a big fan of Madewell and was trying to buy or license the name,‚Äù David Mullen, a clothing designer who now runs a few shops called Save Khaki, told me over the phone. ‚ÄúI would find the label at vintage stores and I loved the way that it looked, and the name itself, what it represented.‚Äù Mullen made trips up to New Bedford to learn more about Madewell, making some of the same stops I made, and for some of the same reasons: What was this company?

He led Gap through its 1990s boom, taking the company from, as a 2010 <i>New Yorker</i> <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-merchant\">profile</a> by Nick Paumgarten put it, ‚Äúa shaggy little jeans chain to a gigantic but fairly nimble purveyor of the stuff everyone wears.‚Äù Called by some in the industry ‚Äúthe Merchant Prince,‚Äù Drexler was ousted in 2002 during a downturn in Gap‚Äôs earnings, and the following year ended up as the chairman and CEO of J.Crew Group Inc. (Madewell declined my request for an interview with Drexler.)</p>\n<p>During those few months, he and Mullen tried to work together on Madewell, but it didn‚Äôt quite work out. ‚ÄúWe kind of made the Madewell thing together, then he put it on hold because he‚Äôd just taken the J.Crew job, and that was a pretty big job,‚Äù said Mullen. ‚ÄúSo I helped him a bit with that and then decided to go off on my own.‚Äù Mullen now has no part in Madewell at all, but he says there‚Äôs no ill will, and speaks highly of Drexler. ‚ÄúIt was more of a timing issue. I was anxious to start something, and it was easier to start something on my own.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Mullen, according to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office <a href=\"http://tsdr.uspto.gov/caseviewer/assignments?caseId=72416485&amp;docIndex=0#docIndex=0\">paperwork</a>, paid $125,000 for that logo and trademark, and nothing else, signing the papers on Jan. 31, 2003; the factories had been closed for nearly 15 years at that point, so there wasn‚Äôt really much to sell. (For the sake of disclosure, neither I nor anyone in my immediate family received any of that money.) According to Mullen, my great-uncle Haskell‚Äôs son Jay Kivowitz set up the sale and kept the earnings, as Haskell died shortly afterward. Jay refused to tell me anything specific about the sale. It‚Äôs a sore spot within the family, though certainly he had the legal right to keep it; he was the sole owner of the company at that point.</p>\n<p>On April 14, 2004, Mullen <a href=\"http://assignments.uspto.gov/assignments/assignment-tm-2837-0724.pdf\">transferred</a> the trademark he‚Äôd gotten from my family over to Drexler. Curiously, the document shows no money trading hands. Mullen, when pressed, said only, ‚ÄúMickey‚Äôs a very fair guy,‚Äù but would not tell me anything further about their agreement besides that he now has no stake whatsoever in Madewell. By then, Drexler was established as the chairman and CEO of J.Crew, and leased the Madewell trademark (as Millard S. Drexler Inc.) to J.Crew Group Inc. for a dollar a year.</p>\n<p>Mullen‚Äôs current operation, <a href=\"http://savekhaki.com/\">Save Khaki</a> has only three small boutiques, all in New York City, and sells only a few products, very carefully designed and chosen. Mullen gushed when talking about his design process; he tried repeatedly to get access to Madewell‚Äôs old factory just to look at whatever detritus was left there since it shut down in the 1980s. ‚ÄúI thought there must be all old kinds of patterns in there, ribbons and buttons and ‚Ä¶ to me that would be priceless,‚Äù he said. Save Khaki‚Äôs clothes, too, are all made in the U.S. ‚Äî some even come from factories in New England, including one in Fall River, the sister town to New Bedford where my mom grew up. The modern Madewell isn‚Äôt run in quite the same way ‚Äî much of the clothing is manufactured overseas, although some of the denim is sourced and produced in the U.S.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúA merchant is someone who figures out how to select, how to smell, how to identify, how to feel, how to time, how to buy, how to sell, and how to hopefully have two plus two equal six,‚Äù Drexler told the <i>New Yorker</i>. As presented there, he is a fluid and reactive figure whose personal tastes and interests and philosophies are irrelevant. This is evidenced by his success with both Gap, a company that unapologetically boomed during the prosperous Clinton era with enormous stores full of casual, affordable clothes, and Madewell, which sells, for example, <a href=\"https://www.madewell.com/madewell_category/LABELSWELOVE/rachelcomey/PRDOVR~B1096/B1096.jsp\">this insane JNCO-looking pair</a> of Rachel Comey-designed pants for $426.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904774\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-30334-1411779212-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"768\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 720px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:19\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904774','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/20/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-30334-1411779212-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Madewell denim on display at their NYC Soho store. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Flickr: momo &amp; her bffs / Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://2.0\">2.0</a>) / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/duoduomollie/7350373834\">Flickr: duoduomollie</a></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Somsack Sikhounmuong, the current head of design for Madewell, is mild-mannered with soft eyes and a trim beard.

To Sikhounmuong, these elements are outside of trends; they are the standards.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this stuff to be disposable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want this piece to be relevant five years from now, that you can still pull it out of your closet.‚Äù Part of that intended timelessness, reflected from the name and logo, appears in the price of the clothing.</p>\n<p>A lot of the products and shops that have come out of the capitalist embrace of authenticity and vintage are silly and fake, but the thing is, if you‚Äôre really going to ape a cultural movement, you have to go all in. Part of the cultural change that spawned Madewell is that being older and more honest and taking the time and making a better product is, well, better. There is much to be scornful of in this world of Mason-jar salads and twirly mustaches, but a major, and admirable, tenet of this specific modern twist on consumer culture is the idea that it is better to do things the right way. It is better to make fewer things than more things, because you can concentrate on those fewer things. This is why Americans of a certain age and class are more impressed by a pizza place that serves nothing but margherita pizza than by Domino‚Äôs, which sells a million combinations of cheese and sauce and bread and meat and will deliver to your door in 30 minutes or less.</p>\n<p>This is not exactly what Madewell is doing, of course, but it is certainly what it is attempting to appear to do. Any veneer of authenticity or oldness is necessarily diffused, not specific, but we‚Äôre OK with that, in part because we like the aesthetic and in part because the stuff really is pretty high quality.</p>\n<p>Most of my interview with Sikhounmuong, which was conducted in a conference room accompanied by two public relations people, was friendly. But eventually I had to ask: Didn‚Äôt he think it was, somehow and in some way, wrong to insinuate that Madewell today has any connection to my family‚Äôs company? Wasn‚Äôt that misleading and just a little bit gross? Sikhounmuong hesitated and looked to the PR person sitting next to him. This wasn‚Äôt really his game: He doesn‚Äôt craft slogans; he designs clothes. Eventually he said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an aspirational slogan. It says we know this name is a great name and we know this brand is a great brand. That‚Äôs what I take from it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not what I take from it. What I‚Äôve taken from it is that my family‚Äôs company probably gave even less of a shit than Madewell does about quality and design and passion. Its clothes were as high quality as they could afford because it was in their best interest to make clothes people were satisfied with. They manufactured in the U.S. because at the time it was cheaper to do so, and because it was easier. They weren‚Äôt noble; companies back then didn‚Äôt construct a facade of nobility and purpose. This was a company founded by a Russian immigrant who was probably an identity thief, a company that regularly stole the intellectual property of competitors if it thought it would sell. Both of the companies named Madewell adhere to the way things were done in their respective times. We look at the past through glasses that bring into focus only what we want, and need, to see; they distort everything else.</p>\n<p>My great-uncle Aaron didn‚Äôt recognize anything on the Madewell website. And I think he would probably look at the exposed brick in a Madewell store and wonder why they didn‚Äôt finish putting up the walls. If Julius were alive, I think he‚Äôd be very impressed that a company called Madewell <a href=\"http://investors.jcrew.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=135311&amp;p=irol-SECText&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTk0ODUwMjImRFNFUT0wJlNFUT0wJlNRREVTQz1TRUNUSU9OX0VOVElSRSZzdWJzaWQ9NTc%3d&amp;ver=jc\">posted</a> revenue of over $180 million in the fiscal year 2013. He would care not at all about whether it was authentic, or what the word ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù even means.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3456197_3904801\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/21/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-6559-1411780002-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3456197_3904801','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/26/21/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-6559-1411780002-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Dan Nosowitz / BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3456197_3900172\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Sign up for our email, and you‚Äôll get our best feature stories every Sunday ‚Äî plus other great stories from around the web!</h2>\n\n\n <div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n  \n   \n     <p>\n</p>\n<form rel:gt_cat=\"[ttp]:content\" action=\"http://buzzfeed.createsend.com/t/t/s/jiuhhh/\" method=\"post\">\n<input rel:gt_act=\"input\" id=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-jiuhhh-jiuhhh\" type=\"text\" style=\"font-size:12pt; height:24px; width: 75%\" placeholder=\" your email address\" required=\"\">\n<br><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<input rel:gt_act=\"sign-up\" type=\"submit\" class=\"button2\" value=\"Sign Me Up!\" name=\"submitNewsletter\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"0\">\n</p>\n</form>\n   \n  \n </div>\n\n <p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://embed.contagiousmedia.com/embed/sub/sign-up-for-our-email-and-youll-get-our-be-ncio2f-e4xq?uri=sign-up-for-our-email-and-youll-get-our-be-ncio2f-e4xq&amp;cb=1416225386\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this embed ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 12:14:31.973299"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannosowitz/how-madewell-bought-and-sold-my-familys-history"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-09/26/18/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-2400-1411771731-3.jpg"], ["title", "Something Borrowed, Something¬†Blue"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 12:14:31.973299"]]

Gates and Buffett gave the same one-word answer: ‚ÄúFocus.‚Äù (See more in¬†<em>The Snowball</em>¬†by Alice Schroeder).</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84367\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">I love the clarity of their answer but I am also concerned by how this can be, to quote Rudyard Kipling, ‚Äútwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.‚Äù I am an advocate for focus in work, life and leadership. However, the subject has a nuance and depth that many people miss. For a start, most people think of there only being one kind of focus.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a noun</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84368\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">When people speak of focus they usually mean having a single goal. It is a static thing, a thing you¬†<em>have</em>. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Roger Bannister relentlessly pursuing his goal of breaking the four-minute mile, John F. Kennedy challenging NASA to put a man on the moon within a decade or, coming back to Bill Gates, a vision of a personal computer on every desk. The upside to this kind of focus is clear and compelling: you pursue a single objective and don‚Äôt get distracted along the way; you build momentum as many different people aligned behind achieving this one goal.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84369\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">However, there is a dark side to focus as a noun. It‚Äôs what we might think of as the Kodak Problem. Kodak was relentlessly focused on a single objective‚Äîand it almost killed them. They found themselves caught off guard by the disruptive innovation of digital cameras. Kodak was so focused on optimizing for traditional film capture and processing that they did not see or accept the transformation in their industry. This is where the second type of focus comes in.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Focus as a verb</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84370\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focus is not just something you¬†<em>have</em>¬†it is also something you¬†<em>do</em>. This type of focus is not static; it is an intense, dynamic, ongoing, iterative process. This kind of focus conjures pictures of Steve Jobs saying to Jony Ive day after day, ‚ÄúThis might be crazy, but what if we‚Ä¶‚Äù until once in a while the idea took the air out of the room. It‚Äôs the constant exploration needed to see what is really going on and what the ‚Äúnoun focus‚Äù should be.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84371\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Imagine if the moment you woke up this morning your eyes focused one time and then never adjusted again. You would be out of focus all day. Our eyes produce clarity through a perpetual process of adjustment. Similarly, in our lives and on our teams, it is not enough to say, ‚ÄúWe have our focus!‚Äù Rather, and adapting Dwight D. Eisenhower statement, ‚ÄúFocus is nothing, focusing is everything.‚Äù That may take the point too far, but it still makes the point that having a focus is insufficient.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84372\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The downside to thinking of focus as a verb¬†only, is that it can lead to being overly reactive. It can lead people to making and remaking decisions too fast for any real momentum to take place. It can result in counterfeit agility where things feel fast but people aren‚Äôt going forward. It can become motion sickness instead of momentum.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84373\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">The answer is to develop and value both types of focus. Professor Henry Mintzberg taught that there are two sources of strategy:</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Deliberate¬†strategy</strong>, where leaders develop a clear vision and map this to long, medium and short term goals (focus as a noun);</li>\n<li>\n<strong>emergent¬†strategy</strong>, where people respond to unanticipated problems and opportunities (focus as a verb).</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84374\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">It is the disciplined pursuit of both of these approaches that best enables us to focus on what is essential. We can plot this on a two by two to see what is at stake.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-231910\" src=\"http://img.qz.com/2014/07/2.jpg?w=900&amp;h=551\" alt=\"2\" width=\"900\" height=\"551\"></p>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84375\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Here are three ways to combine both types of focus to ensure we getting the vital few things done.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>Ask the right questions</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84376\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Bill Gates said of Warren Buffett,<em>¬†‚Äú</em>I first met him‚Ä¶ at a dinner my mother had put together. On my way there, I thought, ‚ÄòWhy would I want to meet this guy who picks stocks?‚Äô I thought he just used various market-related things‚Äîlike volume, or how the price had changed over time‚Äîto make his decisions. But when we started talking that day, he didn‚Äôt ask me about any of those things. Instead he started asking big questions about the fundamentals of our business. ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt IBM do what Microsoft does? Why has Microsoft been so profitable?‚Äô That‚Äôs when I realized he thought about business in a much more profound way than I‚Äôd given him credit for.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"84377\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">In order to¬†have¬†focus we need to escape¬†to¬†focus. As I wrote in¬†<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400517057&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=essentialism+the+disciplined+pursuit+of+less\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essentialism</a>, ‚Äú</em>I once attended a question-and-answer session with Bill at the headquarters of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington. By chance he had just completed his latest ‚ÄòThink Week.‚Äô Though I had heard about this practice, what I didn‚Äôt know was that it goes all the way back to the 1980s and that he stuck to it through the height of Micro- soft‚Äôs expansion. In other words, twice a year, during the busiest and most frenetic time in the company‚Äôs history, he still created time and space to seclude himself for a week and do nothing but read articles (his record is 112) and books, study technology, and think about the bigger picture. Today he still takes the time away from the daily distractions of running his foundation to simply think. Whether you can invest two hours a day, two weeks a year, or even just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"1\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">1</div></div></div></div>\n<h2>Know how valuable your time is</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84378\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">As Bill Gates has written,¬†‚ÄúNo matter how much money you have, you can‚Äôt buy more time. There are only 24 hours in everyone‚Äôs day. Warren has a keen sense of this. He doesn‚Äôt let his calendar get filled up with useless meetings. On the other hand, he‚Äôs very generous with his time for the people he trusts. He gives his close advisers at Berkshire his phone number, and they can just call him up and he‚Äôll answer the phone.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84379\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\">Focusing on what is essential is a powerful ability, perhaps the most powerful in a world where we are so bombarded with distracting ideas, information and opinions. However, if we want to consistently give our energies to what is essential we need to develop¬†both¬†kinds of focus. Only in this way can we answer with confidence the question, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important now?‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"84380\" data-article-id=\"231907\" class=\"annotatable\"><em>This post originally appeared at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140707144749-8353952-the-one-word-answer-to-why-bill-gates-and-warren-buffett-have-been-so-successful?trk=mp-reader-card\">LinkedIn</a>.

Self-control is so fleeting for most people that when Martin Seligman and his colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed two million people and asked them to rank order their strengths in 24 different skills, self-control ended up in the very bottom slot.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"inline-ad  ad-visible\"><iframe id=\"537516121_jkuk\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; max-width: 640px; max-height: 360px;\"></iframe></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126332\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">And when your self-control leaves something to be desired, so does your productivity.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126333\" data-article-id=\"297134\">When it comes to self-control, it is so easy to focus on your failures that your successes tend to pale in comparison. And why shouldn‚Äôt they? Self-control is an effort that‚Äôs intended to help achieve a goal. Failing to control yourself is just that‚Äîa failure. If you‚Äôre trying to avoid digging into that bag of chips after dinner because you want to lose a few pounds and you succeed Monday and Tuesday nights only to succumb to temptation on Wednesday by eating four servings‚Äô worth of the empty calories, your failure outweighs your success. You‚Äôve taken two steps forward and four steps back.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126334\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Since self-control is something we could all use a little help with, I went back to the data to uncover the kinds of things that emotionally intelligent people do to keep themselves productive and in control. They consciously apply these twelve behaviors because they know they work. Some are obvious, others counter-intuitive, but all will help you minimize those pesky failures to boost your productivity.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2><strong>1. They forgive themselves</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126335\" data-article-id=\"297134\">A vicious cycle of failing to control oneself followed by feeling intense self-hatred and disgust is common in attempts at self-control. These emotions typically lead to over-indulging in the offending behavior. When you slip up, it is critical that you forgive yourself and move on. Don‚Äôt ignore how the mistake makes you feel; just don‚Äôt wallow in it. Instead, shift your attention to what you‚Äôre going to do to improve yourself in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126336\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Failure can erode your self-confidence and make it hard to believe you‚Äôll achieve a better outcome in the future. Most of the time, failure results from taking risks and trying to achieve something that isn‚Äôt easy. Emotionally intelligent people know that success lies in their ability to rise in the face of failure, and they can‚Äôt do this when they‚Äôre living in the past. Anything worth achieving is going to require you to take some risks, and you can‚Äôt allow failure to stop you from believing in your ability to succeed. When you live in the past, that is exactly what happens, and your past becomes your present, preventing you from moving forward.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p4\">2. They don‚Äôt say yes unless they really want to<strong><br></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126337\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Research conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge for many people. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it‚Äôs time to say no, emotionally intelligent people avoid phrases like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I can‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not certain.‚Äù Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects of over commitment.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p4\">3.They don‚Äôt seek perfection</h2>\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126338\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Emotionally intelligent people won‚Äôt set perfection as their target because they know it doesn‚Äôt exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you‚Äôre always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward excited about what you‚Äôve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p4\">4. They focus on solutions<strong><br></strong>\n</h2>\n<p class=\"p3 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126339\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you‚Äôre facing, you create and prolong negative emotions which hinder self-control. When you focus on the actions you‚Äôll take to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people won‚Äôt dwell on problems because they know they‚Äôre most effective when they focus on solutions.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>5. They avoid asking ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126340\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, which are detrimental to self-control. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you‚Äôll spend taking action and staying productive (staying productive also happens to calm you down and keep you focused). Productive people know that asking ‚Äúwhat if? will only take them to a place they don‚Äôt want‚Äîor need‚Äîto go. Of course, scenario planning is a necessary and effective strategic planning technique. The key distinction here is to recognize the difference between worry and strategic thinking.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>6. They stay positive</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126341\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">Positive thoughts help you exercise self-control by focusing your brain‚Äôs attention onto the rewards you will receive for your effort. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, self-control is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, self-control is a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, or will happen, no matter how small. If you can‚Äôt think of something from the current day, reflect on the past and look to the future. The point here is that you must have something positive that you‚Äôre ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative, so that you don‚Äôt lose focus.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">7. They eat</h2>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126342\" data-article-id=\"297134\">File this one in the counter-intuitive category, especially if you‚Äôre having trouble controlling your eating. Your brain burns heavily into your stores of glucose when attempting to exert self-control. If your blood sugar is low, you are far more likely to succumb to destructive impulses. Sugary foods spike your sugar levels quickly and leave you drained and vulnerable to impulsive behavior shortly thereafter. Eating something that provides a slow burn for your body, such as whole grain rice or meat, will give you a longer window of self-control. So, if you‚Äôre having trouble keeping yourself out of the company candy bin when you‚Äôre hungry, make sure you eat something else if you want to have a fighting chance.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p2\">8. They sleep</h2>\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126343\" data-article-id=\"297134\">I‚Äôve beaten this one to death over the years and can‚Äôt say enough about the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and maintaining your focus and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day‚Äôs memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams), so that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don‚Äôt get enough‚Äîor the right kind‚Äîof sleep. Sleep deprivation raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present, which are a major productivity killer. Being busy often makes you feel as if you must sacrifice sleep to stay productive, but sleep deprivation diminishes your productivity so much throughout the day that you‚Äôre better off sleeping.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126344\" data-article-id=\"297134\">When you‚Äôre tired, your brain‚Äôs ability to absorb glucose is greatly diminished. This makes it difficult to control the impulses that derail your focus. What‚Äôs more, without enough sleep you are more likely to crave sugary snacks to compensate for low glucose levels. So, if you‚Äôre trying to exert self-control over your eating, getting a good night‚Äôs sleep‚Äîevery night‚Äîis one of the best moves you can make.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>9. They exercise</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126345\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. If you‚Äôre having trouble resisting the impulse to walk over to the office next door to let somebody have it, just keep on walking. You should have the impulse under control by the time you get back.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2><strong>10. They meditate</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126346\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Meditation actually trains your brain to become a self-control machine. Even simple techniques like mindfulness, which involves taking as little as five minutes a day to focus on nothing more than your breathing and your senses, improves your self-awareness and your brain‚Äôs ability to resist destructive impulses. Buddhist monks appear calm and in control for a reason. Give it a try.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>11. They ride the wave</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p2 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126347\" data-article-id=\"297134\">Desire and distraction have the tendency to ebb and flow like the tide. When the impulse you need to control is strong, waiting out this wave of desire is usually enough to keep yourself in control. When you feel as if you must give in, the rule of thumb here is to wait at least 10 minutes before succumbing to temptation. You‚Äôll often find that the great wave of desire is now little more than a ripple that you have the power to step right over.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<h2>12. They squash negative self-talk</h2>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126348\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">A big final step in exercising self-control involves stopping negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that‚Äîthoughts, not facts. When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it‚Äôs time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you‚Äôre doing and write down what you‚Äôre thinking. Once you‚Äôve taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126349\" data-article-id=\"297134\" class=\"annotatable\">You can bet that your statements aren‚Äôt true any time you use words like ‚Äúnever,‚Äù ‚Äúworst,‚Äù ‚Äúever,‚Äù etc. If your statements still look like facts once they‚Äôre on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you trust and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain‚Äôs natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p class=\"p1 annotatable\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126350\" data-article-id=\"297134\">The important thing to remember is you have to give these strategies the opportunity to work. This means recognizing the moments where you are struggling with self-control and, rather than giving in to impulse, taking a look at these strategies and giving them a go before you give in.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"item-share-tools article-footer\">\n<div class=\"short-url\"><input type=\"text\" name=\"shortURL\" value=\"http://qz.com/297134\"></div>\n<div class=\"share-buttons colored\"><ul data-author=\"Travis Bradberry\" data-title=\"How successful people stay productive\" data-on=\"none\">\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a title=\"Tweet\" class=\"share-action icon-twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=How%20successful%20people%20stay%20productive&amp;url=http://qz.com/297134&amp;via=qz\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a title=\"Share on Facebook\" class=\"share-action icon-facebook\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://qz.com/297134\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"linkedin\"><a title=\"Share on LinkedIn\" class=\"share-action icon-linkedin\" href=\"http://linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://qz.com/297134&amp;title=How%20successful%20people%20stay%20productive&amp;summary=This%20post%20originally%20appeared%20at%20LinkedIn.%20Follow%20Travis%20here.%20TalentSmart%C2%A0has%20tested%20more%20than%20a%20million%20people%20and%20found%20that%20the%20upper%20echelons%20of%20top%20performance%20are%20filled%20with%20people%20who%20are%20high%20in%20emotional%20intelligence%20(90%25%20of%20top%20performers,%20to%20be%20exact).%20The%20hallmark%20of%20emotional%20intelligence%20is%20self-control%E2%80%94a%20skill%20that%20unleashes%20massive%20productivity%20by%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"email\"><a title=\"Email\" class=\"share-action icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=Quartz:%20How%20successful%20people%20stay%20productive&amp;body=http://qz.com/297134%0A%0AThis%20post%20originally%20appeared%20at%20LinkedIn.%20Follow%20Travis%20here.%20TalentSmart%C2%A0has%20tested%20more%20than%20a%20million%20people%20and%20found%20that%20the%20upper%20echelons%20of%20top%20performance%20are%20filled%20with%20people%20who%20are%20high%20in%20emotional%20intelligence%20(90%%20of%20top%20performers,%20to%20be%20exact).%20The%20hallmark%20of%20emotional%20intelligence%20is%20self-control%E2%80%94a%20skill%20that%20unleashes%20massive%20productivity%20by%20%5B%E2%80%A6%5D%0A%0A\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\n<li class=\"whatsapp\"><a title=\"Share on WhatsApp\" class=\"share-action icon-whats-app\" href=\"whatsapp://send?text=How%20successful%20people%20stay%20productive:%20http://qz.com/297134\"></a></li>\n</ul></div>\n<div id=\"related-headlines-297134\" class=\"empty\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 12:39:46.839419"], ["link_identifier", "http://qz.com/297134"], ["main_img_url", "http://img.qz.com/2014/11/rtr4crck.jpg?w=940, http://img.qz.com/2014/11/rtr4crck.jpg?w=1880 2x"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-15"], ["title", "How successful people stay productive"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 12:39:46.839419"]]

As with many religions, complete unthinking devotion is required from its practitioners. Nothing in life is allowed to be more important than our children, and we must never speak a disloyal word about our relationships with our offspring. Children always come first. We accept this premise so reflexively today that we forget that it was not always so.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"4\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">4</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111218\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In our recently published book, <em><a href=\"http://diversionbooks.com/ebooks/sacred-cows-truth-about-divorce-and-marriage\" target=\"_blank\">Sacred Cows</a></em>, we took on our society‚Äôs nonsensical but deeply ingrained beliefs surrounding marriage and divorce. We often get asked whether we will next address the sacred cows of modern parenting, at which point we ask the speaker to please lower his voice, and we look nervously over our shoulders to make sure that nobody has overheard the question.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111219\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">To understand the frightening power of the parenthood religion, one need look no further than the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/fashion/27love.html\" target=\"_blank\">essay in The New York Times </a>by Ayelet Waldman, where the author explained that she loved her husband more than her four children.¬†On ‚ÄúOprah Where Are They Now,‚Äù the author recently reaffirmed the sentiments reflected in her New York Times article, and she added that her outlook has had a positive impact on her children by giving them a sense of security <a href=\"http://www.oprah.com/own-where-are-they-now/Does-Ayelet-Waldman-Still-Love-Husband-More-Than-Children-Video\" target=\"_blank\">in their parents‚Äô relationship</a>. Following the publication of her essay, Waldman was not only shouted down by America for being a bad mother; strangers threatened her physically and told her that they would report her to child protective services.

Nobody would have placed such a sign on a car if it were not already understood by society that the life of a human achieves its peak value at birth and declines thereafter. A toddler is almost as precious as a baby, but a teenager less so, and by the time that baby turns fifty, it seems that nobody cares much anymore if someone crashes into her car.

We are allowed to say bad things about our spouses, our parents, our aunts and uncles, but try saying, ‚ÄúMy kid doesn‚Äôt have a lot of friends because she‚Äôs not a super likable person,‚Äù and see how fast you get dropped from the PTA.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"1\" data-thread-id=\"111222\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">When people choose to have children, they play a lottery. Children have the same range of positive and negative characteristics as adults, and the personalities of some children are poorly matched with those of their parents. Nature has protected children against such a circumstance by endowing them with irresistible cuteness early on, and by ensuring that parents bond with children sufficiently strongly that our cave-dwelling ancestors didn‚Äôt push their offspring out in a snowbank when they misbehaved. Much as parents love their children and have their best interests at heart, however, they don‚Äôt always like them. That guy at the office who everyone thinks is a jerk was a kid once upon a time, and there‚Äôs a pretty good chance that his parents also noticed that he could be a jerk.

This falls into the category of thou-shalt-have-no-other-gods-before-me. As with many religious crimes, judgment is not applied evenly across the sexes. Mothers must devote themselves to their children above anyone or anything else, but many wives would be offended if their husbands said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty great, but my love for you will never hold a candle to the love I have for John Junior.‚Äù</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"3\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">3</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"111224\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">Mothers are also holy in a way that fathers are not expected to be. Mothers live in a clean, cheerful world filled with primary colors and children‚Äôs songs, and they don‚Äôt think about sex. A father could admit to desiring his wife without seeming like a distracted parent, but society is not as willing to cut Ms. Waldman that same slack. It is unseemly for a mother to enjoy pleasures that don‚Äôt involve her children.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"2\" data-thread-id=\"111225\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">There are doubtless benefits that come from elevating parenthood to the status of a religion, but there are obvious pitfalls as well. Parents who do not feel free to express their feelings honestly are less likely to resolve problems at home. Children who are raised to believe that they are the center of the universe have a tough time when their special status erodes as they approach adulthood. Most troubling of all, couples who live entirely child-centric lives can lose touch with one another to the point where they have nothing left to say to one another when the kids leave home.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right has-annotations\" data-count=\"2\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count number\"><div class=\"numberInside\">2</div></div></div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-annotation-count=\"4\" data-thread-id=\"111226\" data-article-id=\"273255\" class=\"annotatable\">In the 21st century, most Americans marry for love. We choose partners who we hope will be our soulmates for life. When children come along, we believe that we can press pause on the soulmate narrative, because parenthood has become our new priority and religion. We raise our children as best we can, and we know that we have succeeded if they leave us, going out into the world to find partners and have children of their own. Once our gods have left us, we try to pick up the pieces of our long neglected marriages and find new purpose.

A bunch of funds of roughly the same size all look at their portfolios around year 5‚Äîsee a bunch of unexitable businesses and then proceed to give each others‚Äô companies an up-round (A gives a 3x up-round to B‚Äôs investee, B gives a 3x to C‚Äôs company, and C in turn returns the favour to A‚Äôs investee.)</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126522\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Net result?

Sometimes 15. Sometimes even more. Ironically, if I‚Äôd taken VC funding for my own startup‚ÄîI‚Äôd have been worse off today, with a huge artificial pressure to exit.

Like most imported processes, it‚Äôs not right for the rest of the world. In fact, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs right for the US either. Dump the eight and 10 year fund structures.

Perhaps they could be advised that early-stage, where the best returns are, shouldn‚Äôt be their cup of tea‚Äî or perhaps they could learn to be more patient if they want the super-huge returns.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<span class=\"pull-quote\"><span class=\"quote-line\">¬†</span><span>Come with a Berkshire Hathaway mentality‚Äînot a Gordon Gecko built-to-Flipkart mindset</span><span class=\"quote-line\">¬†</span></span><p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126528\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Some other LPs‚Äîfamily offices, endowments, foundations and the like‚Äîshould gravitate more to the early stage but their large bite sizes get in the way. They may have billions to invest and apparent logic may decide that each investment should be $100 million or more but that‚Äôs too large for early-stage funds.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126529\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">It‚Äôs unwieldy, yes‚Äîbecause they have more money to deploy than most early-stage funds can manage‚Äîbut long-term early-stage funds are the right match for their tenure and temperament. They should figure that a teeny bit more work on their part‚Äîto write smaller cheques‚Äîwill help them participate at the steepest part of the growth curve of new businesses.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126530\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Second, look to build real businesses that grow over the long term. Come with a Berkshire Hathaway mentality‚Äînot a Gordon Gecko built-to-Flipkart mindset. Also, why exit just because the company does? In firm after firm, their values have risen much more after an IPO, so why not stay in and capture the gains for your LPs years after the company goes public? A longer tenure allows you to do that.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126531\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">Third, even with all this, look to make the companies grow faster‚Äînot by putting unreachable milestones or unnecessary funding in front of them‚Äîbut by helping them fill out their teams much earlier with good people.</p>\n<div class=\"anno-right\" data-count=\"0\"><div class=\"regular\"><div class=\"count plus\"></div></div></div>\n<p data-annotation-count=\"0\" data-thread-id=\"126532\" data-article-id=\"297245\" class=\"annotatable\">No good CXO tends to join a startup till its third year and second round of funding. So most startups waste a few years dawdling and gather speed only after year 3. Why not get a bunch of these folks working for the fund as a SWAT team of CXOs, and you could deploy them across your startups from day 1?

A longer term can help ride out up and down markets, can make next round funding even more viable‚Äîand also gets rid of the ‚Äútoo early to the market‚Äù problem.

The gangly, boyish, and eminently charming actor, best known for playing Marius in 2012‚Äôs <i>Les Mis√©rables</i>, is meant to be seated on a plush couch in his inordinately posh Manhattan hotel suite, but he seems incapable of staying put. He frequently springs up to further demonstrate whatever point he‚Äôs in the middle of making, and even when he is seated, his deep, throaty voice races headlong out of him, his mouth often tripping over his words.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had spaghetti bolognese for lunch, which felt amazing at the time, and then I hit a wall,‚Äù he tells BuzzFeed News at the outset of his interview last month. ‚ÄúI have a vat of coffee here, which is propelling me back into form. So hopefully my chat will not stink.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Redmayne‚Äôs infectious verve is, ironically, in service of explaining how he learned to keep his body resolutely stiff and static. With the new film <i>The Theory of Everything</i>, the 32-year-old Redmayne has been winning the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alisonwillmore/benedict-cumberbatch-vs-eddie-redmayne\">best reviews</a> of his young career, as well as considerable Oscar buzz, for his performance as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who has famously spent the vast majority of his career in a wheelchair due to a physically debilitating motor neuron disease similar to ALS. (One typical rave, from <i><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20869525,00.html\">Entertainment Weekly</a></i>: ‚ÄúRedmayne‚Äôs astonishing transformation lends a touch of magic to the material.‚Äù)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255800\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 245px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255800','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-1272-1415928670-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Eddie Redmayne in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The film, which is currently playing in New York and Los Angeles and expands into more theaters on Nov. 14, tracks Hawking‚Äôs physical decline from his early days as a doctoral candidate at Cambridge. Its main emotional focus, however, is how the disease affected his romance with and eventual marriage to Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), whose memoir served as the basis for the film. Playing Hawking proposed one of the most intimidating challenges imaginable for an actor: Faithfully portraying the physical specificity of Hawking‚Äôs disease meant bottling up virtually every tool available to capture his emotional inner life.</p>\n<p>But according to <i>The Theory of Everything</i>‚Äôs director, James Marsh (<i>Man on Wire</i>), it was a challenge that Redmayne was up to from the moment the two first met to discuss the role. ‚ÄúEddie‚Äôs a very intelligent actor,‚Äù Marsh says a few weeks later on the phone. ‚ÄúI was struck by how much he understood the nature of the psychology of the role, and what he had to do is to physically prepare for what then would become an emotional performance. The physicality needed to be in place and embedded, essentially, into his preparation. Once that was in place, then the real work began to bring this character to life emotionally. He understood all that from the get-go.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255075\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"661\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 613px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:1\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255075','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr07/longform-2802-1415923114-37.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by David J.

(Instead, he studied the history of art at Cambridge.) ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wondered if at drama school you get given [a] process,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúEvery single job I do, whether it‚Äôs theater or film, I‚Äôm still grappling to find a process. But interestingly, when I got cast in [<i>Theory of Everything</i>], my instinct was to make it quite a formal one.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Part of that instinct stemmed from his understanding that the practical demands of film production ‚Äî shooting the film out of sequence ‚Äî would add yet another layer of complication to the job of capturing Hawking‚Äôs physical deterioration. ‚ÄúI had to absolutely map what his physical decline was going to be,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI wanted to do that with a dancer. ‚Ä¶ Quite particularly on film, people are a bit scared to ask actors to do [a scene] again. But with dancers, they‚Äôre extraordinary artists, and it‚Äôs like‚Äù ‚Äî he began clapping his hands ‚Äî ‚Äú<i>do it again, do it again, do it again</i> until you get it right.

For that, he relied especially on Marsh and Jones. <i>The Theory of Everything</i> spends just as much time exploring Jane Hawking‚Äôs life as it does Stephen‚Äôs, and how all-consuming it became for her to care for her husband. ‚ÄúI remember being in a rehearsal room with Eddie, and Eddie‚Äôs in the chair, and then suddenly you feel as the person playing the carer you have this enormous responsibility,‚Äù Jones says. ‚ÄúAt a certain point, Stephen couldn‚Äôt just lift up a spoon. So Jane‚Äôs got to be there doing it for him. So suddenly, I was like, <i>Gosh, I‚Äôve got to be the responsible one in this situation!</i> She was Stephen‚Äôs movement in the world.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Indeed, the circumstances of their characters put a great deal of literal and figurative weight on Jones‚Äô shoulders. ‚ÄúNormally, when you arrive on a film set each morning, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOK, we‚Äôre going to shoot the scene here,‚Äô‚Äù says Redmayne. ‚ÄúJames will have an opinion. Then maybe Felicity will say, ‚ÄòActually, maybe I‚Äôll try it in this seat.‚Äô You‚Äôre playing with ideas. But virtually every single day on this, I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that. I can‚Äôt move from here.‚Äô She has to do all the heavy lifting ‚Äî a lot of it, as far as keeping the energy in scenes. It was really complicated. She was a sensational friend throughout it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Before filming, Jones and Redmayne knew each other from their earlier work during Michael Grandage‚Äôs tenure overseeing the Donmar Warehouse Theatre in London, but they only really became ‚Äúgreat friends,‚Äù as Redmayne puts it, while making the film. That friendship was sealed very early in the production during a scene in which, after learning of his diagnosis, Jane pushes a deeply depressed Stephen to play croquet with her ‚Äî only to be quietly devastated when she sees just how physically debilitated he‚Äôd already become. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs setting up a challenge, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù says Jones. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt going to be easy.‚Äô It‚Äôs totally a test. And he‚Äôs saying if you can get through this, then maybe we can spend our lives together.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3511973_4255860\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"425\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 377px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3511973_4255860','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/20/enhanced/webdr08/longform-1674-1415929166-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jones and Redmayne in the croquet scene in <i>The Theory of Everything</i> </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Liam Daniel / Focus Features</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It became a kind of test for Jones and Redmayne, as well, after Redmayne asked Jones to tease him off camera when it was time for him to shoot Stephen struggling to play croquet. ‚ÄúThat takes great trust, because she basically sort of started in,‚Äù he says, laughing. ‚ÄúAnd she knew where to hit me.

It‚Äôs her birthday ‚Äî she‚Äôs leaving for the evening, and wants to say good-bye to her co-star and friend. Immediately, Redmayne leaps up, grabs a glass, and bursts into a boisterous rendition of ‚ÄúHappy Birthday.‚Äù (The second plate of cake and third glass of champagne, by the way, is for the BuzzFeed News reporter in the room, which is both enormously kind and incredibly savvy PR.)</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen will I see you?‚Äù says Redmayne, swaying back and forth and sipping his champagne. ‚ÄúTomorrow?

Are you having fun?‚Äù</p>\n<p>After Jones has left (‚ÄúI decided to go really low-key and just see one of my best friends,‚Äù she says of her birthday plans), Redmayne returns to his couch, champagne in hand. Asked what it was like to learn that Stephen Hawking had enjoyed the film ‚Äî and the profound effort that went into his performance ‚Äî for the first time that afternoon he grows quiet, his words coming slowly, his body still. ‚ÄúIt means everything, really,‚Äù he says, his voice heavy with emotion. ‚ÄúThe weight of those high stakes had been sitting on my shoulders for an age, and ‚Äî that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre telling the story, because he‚Äôs an extraordinary human being, as is Jane.

Big, blank, and imaginary; it was perfect. A boy‚Äôs world of dominoed dunes and empty spaces that stretched and shimmered across the pages my mother read to me every evening in our Nebraska apartment.</p>\n<p>My father had just left, and I was having trouble sleeping. My baby brother didn‚Äôt seem bothered. But I was a couple years older and more easily frightened. During the day I rarely spoke or cried, but at night I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes. My mom must have been struggling too, because at some point during that ugly stretch reading became our thing. There had always been bedtime stories, but this was something different. This was a mother‚Äôs magic trick, the borrowing of alternate worlds to escape our own.</p>\n<p>We started with Bible stories, bearded patriarchs and long robes, before working our way through the public library‚Äôs collection of <i>The Black Stallion</i> books. I adored Alec, the redheaded hero of the series, almost as much as I loved the Black, the wild Arabian stallion at its center. The pair appealed to me because they were me, or at least the me I wanted to be. Alec was young and independent, free from parental interference, and the Black was big and loyal, just like my own horse.</p>\n<p>After the divorce, my mother had fixated on the animal, stubbornly refusing to sell our one luxury. Molly wasn‚Äôt black or a stallion, but my mind was already learning to skip past the awkward inconsistencies of life. I didn‚Äôt know Palomino or mare. But I knew horse. And that‚Äôs what I had. Sitting on Molly wearing a plastic cowboy hat, I spent my days playing through the stories we read at night. One minute I was Alec racing the Black through Arabia, the next I was Jedediah Smith crossing the Mojave. Already I was learning the dangers of the desert. Smith, my mother would read one night, died on the Santa Fe Trail full of Comanche arrows. Another night, Alec got trampled. Slowly, as the stories began to accumulate, tragedy seeped into play. ‚ÄúSorry, Molly,‚Äù I would whisper toward the end of our sessions, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre lost and I have to eat you.‚Äù Patting her neck, I tried to ease the sting of my words. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôll survive.‚Äù</p>\n<p>As our reading times expanded, so too did my imagination. What started as a desperate attempt to get a scared little boy to sleep had grown into a ritualized treat: reading time with mom. The comfort of her voice gave way to the rhythm of the story, as I went from not knowing the shapes of letters to sounding out words. Only later, when I started to go off on my own, reading large chunks while she was away at work, did things change. For a while we had two sets of books: ours and mine. But that didn‚Äôt last either. I read too much, too fast. And as my stack of library books dwindled, I tended to steal from our shared pile. My tastes changed as well, moving out from the half-shelves around the library checkout counter to Hardy Boys mysteries and western biographies deeper in the stacks. But I never left the desert, not really.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264317\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1100\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1417px; top: 1052px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264317','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-9483-1416066150-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>First it was Cairo, on a semester abroad program during my junior year. Then it was the Peace Corps in Jordan after graduation. That was the beginning, a decade in which I spent much of my time living in the Middle East. It was also the decade of 9/11 and a pair of massive wars.</p>\n<p>Cairo was exotic but crowded and Jordan‚Äôs eastern desert was drab and dreary, more volcanic rock than sand. But Yemen was different. Vibrant and stark, it felt like the underside of a rainbow. Sanaa had character and a wild, intoxicating charm. Politics, even at the top, was real and contested. Ali Abdullah Salih, a rough-talking president with a whiskey habit, had been in charge since before I was born, but even he was constrained. Tribes mattered more than parties, and alliances were always in flux. For a year, I spent my mornings reading Arab histories and my afternoons parsing rumors in sweaty little rooms where the smoke floated in layers. I was 24 years old and I was hooked.</p>\n<p>A trio of guards and doormen were my guides that first year. They taught me how to chew qat, rubbing and polishing the leaves, and welcomed me into their circle. We went shooting together in the desert, and opened up to each other in the awkward, fumbling manner of boys learning to become men.</p>\n<p>One day, Shaqib confessed this was how he imagined heaven: the four of us sitting around chewing qat, laughing and joking. ‚ÄúParadise,‚Äù he told me, ‚Äúis the best of this world.‚Äù And that year the best of our world took place in a cramped little guard shack with crumbling walls off al-Bawniya Street. Outside everything was a mess with horrifying pictures from Abu Ghraib and Saddam in a spider hole. But inside there was the gentle grace of centuries and the human warmth and dignity that in Yemen could transcend everything else. Politics was one thing; personal interactions were something else.</p>\n<p>Most evenings, after qat, I slipped off on my own for a quiet walk. I usually turned right toward Zubayri Street and my favorite bookshop, dusty and disorderly, before reversing course for Sanaa‚Äôs old city and a glass of milky tea. History lived near the surface on those walks. I passed a bombed-out palace from Yemen‚Äôs last revolution in 1962 and, a bit further on, a paved-over square where the imam used to behead dissidents with a single stroke from a sword called ‚ÄúThe Purifier.‚Äù The palace had been converted into a secret prison, and teenagers played soccer all night in the square. But the past was still there if you knew where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264376\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264376\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264376\"}}' rel:description=\"For the first time I felt physically unsafe.

In late 2012, after the Arab Spring and the uprisings that forced Salih to step down, I scheduled another quick trip. I had lived through the revolution in Cairo, and had seen the expectations of change and a better life inflate and then burst leaving everyone more confused than ever. Yemen had changed as well. No one seemed to know the rules anymore. Salih was out and security was evaporating. There was a mad scramble for power that fall, and for the first time I felt physically unsafe. It was just a feeling, impossible to quantify, but I couldn‚Äôt shake it.</p>\n<p>Yemeni friends on Twitter and Facebook disagreed with my assessment, claiming I had lost my feel for the country. And maybe I had. What did I know about predicting violence? But I wasn‚Äôt alone. Among the small group of Yemen watchers, the numbers had started to lose their meaning with repetition: 40% chance of bombing, 60% chance of being kidnapped. They were guesses without an anchor. No one knew anything for certain. Western embassies issued travel warnings, but they were as vague as everything else. Yemen was bad ‚Äî maybe not Iraq bad ‚Äî but the speculation kept getting worse.</p>\n<p>Still, earlier this spring I decided to go back one more time. I pitched it to my editors as a three-story trip. But in my mind, it was a final farewell. I was getting married in a few months, and I wanted to move on and write about other things. I‚Äôd quit smoking years earlier and my twenties had slipped into my thirties. I was ready for a change. On March 6, I boarded the plane for my last trip to Yemen.</p>\n<p>Sixteen days later I was done. I had my three stories, or at least the notes and interviews to write them. But I didn‚Äôt want to leave, not yet. Something was still missing. Instead of flying home early, I compromised: One more story.</p>\n<p>I already knew the one I‚Äôd do. The ghost story every writer has, the one they obsess over and worry about; always researching, never writing. Mine was a tragedy that started with a Guantanamo interrogation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Detainee: I am from Urday City in Yemen, not a city in al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ My city is very far from the city of al-Qaeda‚Ä¶ That is not my name and I am not from that city‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: al-Qaeda is not a city. It is the name of an organization.</p>\n<p>Detainee: Whether it is a city or an organization, I am not from al-Qaeda. I am from Urday City.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Are you from Yemen?</p>\n<p>Detainee: Yes, I am from Urday.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you travel from Yemen to Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I went from Yemen to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Did you do that in the year 2000?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I don‚Äôt know the time.</p>\n<p>Tribunal President: Was it the year 1421?</p>\n<p>Detainee: I am from a village, I cannot tell time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The detainee, Adnan Abd al-Latif, was a mentally unstable man who had suffered severe brain damage as a result of a car crash in 1994. Twice he had been cleared for release, but each time something went wrong and he remained locked in his cell, counting the days until there was nothing left to count. On Sept. 10, 2012, he committed suicide. He had been in Guantanamo Bay for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs case seemed to get at all the horrors of that lost decade: a handicapped man who confused al-Qaeda with a Yemeni village of the same name, locked up as the worst of the worst. For 10 years, while Latif befriended the iguanas and banana rats that wandered into his cell, the U.S. and Yemen fought for custody. Neither side would give in. The U.S. had him but wouldn‚Äôt let him go; Yemen wanted him but couldn‚Äôt get him.</p>\n<p>Then Latif killed himself with a fistful of pills and positions changed. Now neither country wanted him. The U.S. needed him gone, but Yemen wouldn‚Äôt take him. In death, just as in life, he was in legal limbo ‚Äî neither here nor there. Instead of Guantanamo, Latif was sent to Germany, where his body was frozen and stored at Ramstein Air Base while the two countries argued over who had to take the corpse.</p>\n<p>Latif‚Äôs story was sad, but mostly it was just human. He wasn‚Äôt nameless or faceless, an abstract stand-in for our fears. He was a man with a history and a family, and I wanted to write about them, to tell his story. In my mind it was less about Guantanamo Bay than it was about the withering of hope and how a single man had been ground down to nothing by a pair of bureaucracies. But no one else seemed to see it this way. Obama had already ordered the prison closed. He just hadn‚Äôt succeeded. Guantanamo was still open, and indefinite detention was still the law of the land. But the country had moved on; a collective forgetting that let us pretend everything had changed when nothing had.</p>\n<p>Before I left the U.S. I had reached out to one of the Guantanamo lawyers and he gave me the name of Latif‚Äôs brother in Yemen. Muhammad lived in Taizz, four hours south of Sanaa. But Yemen was still coming apart, and the roads were too dangerous for a drive. I asked Muhammed if he would fly to Sanaa for an interview.</p>\n<p>Since arriving in Sanaa I had been working with Shuaib, a young fixer and friend, who knew how to get things done in a country where nothing worked. That morning I met him at the ticket office to buy Muhammad‚Äôs plane ticket. The money I had just collected from Western Union went from me to Shuaib to the man behind the counter. I signed the receipt, the man behind the counter stamped it, and Shuaib called Taizz to confirm that Muhammad was on his way to the airport. It was just after 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, March 22. Muhammad‚Äôs flight landed in three hours, and Shuaib wanted breakfast.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the ticket office, Zubayri Street had been quiet. In another hour the shadows would be gone and the street would be noisy and hot with four jumbled lanes of traffic. But for the moment it was neither. Caught between the two, Zubayri Street came to life in fits and starts. Shuaib moved through it quickly, claiming he could smell something good. I smelled diesel and cigarettes. After a block whatever scent he was tracking had disappeared, and he gave up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go in here,‚Äù he said. The restaurant looked like every other one on the street: an open front with a roll-up shutter, a counter in the front, kitchen in the back, and long metal tables in between. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said. But I didn‚Äôt really care. I‚Äôd already had breakfast; I just wanted another cup of coffee. ‚ÄúThis is fine.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Stepping up onto the sidewalk, Shuaib bumped into a soldier who was coming out of the restaurant, catching his windbreaker on the man‚Äôs rifle. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he mumbled, as he reached over to untangle his jacket. The man just looked at him, taking in Shuaib‚Äôs youth and his slight frame. And then he saw me. I was used to it, the attention and the double takes. Yemenis tend to stare at obvious foreigners, observing them as if they were under glass. But this time the lack of words was disconcerting. We were in the man‚Äôs space, inches from his face with Shuaib‚Äôs jacket hooked on his rifle. The whole thing was too intimate for silence. But the man in the olive green uniform didn‚Äôt say a word. Only his eyes moved, following Shuaib‚Äôs fingers as they slid up the barrel of his gun. Then we were free and moving again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_right_small   \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264382\" rel:buzz_num=\"14\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:description=\"It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3513705_4264382\" rel:via=\"gregorydjohnsen\" rel:sub_title=\"It%20was%20nothing%20and%20he%20was%20no%20one,%20a%20soldier%20with%20a%\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:14\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3513705_4264382\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3513705_4264382\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:14\" rel:count=\"4\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Bitter'; font-weight: 400; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #004F9E; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">It was nothing and he was no one, a soldier with a gun in a country that had plenty of both.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>That was it, a few seconds on the street before breakfast.

I saw him as soon as we left the restaurant: Ten yards up the road next to another man in a military uniform. Both of them were young, and both had guns.</p>\n<p>The first man, the one Shuaib had bumped into, crossed the space between us surprisingly quickly and grabbed his arm. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù he asked in rough Arabic, with a gesture toward me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my friend,‚Äù Shuaib replied.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIs he a foreigner?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Shuaib said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an American researcher.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the man said, pulling Shuaib toward the street. ‚ÄúCome to the base with us.

Grabbing my arm, he started pulling me toward the street. My eyes followed my body and I saw the yellow-and-white taxi: driver inside, back door open. And then I knew.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264321\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"764\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 716px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264321','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25145-1416066239-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Illustration by Sam Kalda for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I had played through this scenario dozens of times.

The man pulled harder, and we were scuffling. There was no punching or screaming, none of the things I would have imagined, just a weird one-armed tug-of-war over a few yards of asphalt. I was older and stronger, but he had a gun. His hand, dry and cracked, slipped down past my wrist, catching on the backpack that I had slung over one arm. For a second, I thought about dropping the backpack and running. But it had the rest of the $600 I‚Äôd pulled out of Western Union, my passport, and all my notebooks from two weeks of work. I tugged.</p>\n<p>Several Yemenis had gathered around us in a loose half-circle. I had always assumed that if something went really wrong, some Yemeni would step up to save me. That had been my insurance policy as I moved through a society that was not my own. But now I was being taken and they were just watching.</p>\n<p>In our world, evil typically wears a mask. It stalks about in disguise, peeking out through the cracks in our humanity. We rarely see it or recognize it when we do, but on that morning in Sanaa it was unmistakable. Dropping Shuaib‚Äôs arm, the man grabbed for his gun. That‚Äôs when I thought he would start shooting. Shuaib moved fast, escaping up the street and scrambling for cover. The second man let go of my backpack to chamber his own bullet, and then I was running too.</p>\n<p>I remembered to zigzag as I ducked into a different restaurant and headed for the back. My plan was to run through the kitchen and escape out the back and then make a big loop back to the American Institute, where I was staying. I made it to the rear of the restaurant, but as I tried to go through the kitchen, one of the Yemeni workers blocked me.</p>\n<p><i>‚ÄúMamnu‚Äòa,‚Äù</i> he said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúForbidden,‚Äù I panted back dumbly. He just stared at me and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> a second time.</p>\n<p>I was trapped. The restaurant was laid out like a giant L, one long main room with a right-angled nook for a sink. I was around the corner by the sink, only a few feet from the door to the kitchen and the way out. But I could no longer see the street and I started to panic. I had to move, to get out of the restaurant. Any second, the men were going to come around the corner. In my mind, I saw the German diplomat lying dead on the grocery store tile.</p>\n<p>I tried to get through the kitchen door a second time, but another employee wrapped me in a giant bear hug and said <i>mamnu‚Äòa</i> yet again. I had no more moves. There was nothing left to react against. Shaking as fear crashed over adrenaline, I tried to think. I needed a plan and I didn‚Äôt have one.</p>\n<p>Fumbling with my backpack, I found my phone and called a contact at the U.S. Embassy. Earlier that week I‚Äôd met him for lunch, seen his guard detail, and ridden in the armored SUV. Maybe he could come to the restaurant and escort me out. But no one picked up. I dialed a second number; still nothing.</p>\n<p>Waiters were still moving back and forth with food and people were eating. But I was stuck, cowering in a corner waiting for whatever came next. A couple of Yemenis came over to tell me that the men were gone, but I didn‚Äôt believe them. Then, someone walked over with a metal cup of water in his hand.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre under my protection.</p>\n<p>I wanted to laugh. He had a cup; the men outside had guns. I explained that they were trying to kidnap me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a foreigner?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúSyrian?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm American.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù he shrugged, and walked away. After that, no one else approached me.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Shuaib came around the corner. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre gone,‚Äù he said. But my heart was still pounding, and I no longer trusted Yemen or my instincts. I didn‚Äôt move. The corner had become safe.</p>\n<p>Shuaib left and came back. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre really gone.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù</p>\n<p>We grabbed a cab in front of the Chinese Embassy, while Shuaib called the police and I gave the driver directions. ‚ÄúThose weren‚Äôt real soldiers,‚Äù Shuaib told me with the phone pressed up against his ear. I held my bag as he told the driver to go the wrong way up a one-way street. Two minutes later we were in front of the American Institute.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStay inside,‚Äù Shuaib implored. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I called the embassy and reported the incident. I told the director and I emailed Asha. Then the electricity went out and there were no more distractions. I imagined Shuaib hit in the head and dumped out of the car. I would be taken to some house for a few days and then smuggled past the checkpoints around Sanaa. After that I‚Äôd be gone. It had happened before, and it would happen again. Sitting alone in my room on a sunny Saturday morning in Sanaa, I felt my fear grow wild and unchained like a beast come back to life. It was the fear of a little boy who didn‚Äôt understand the world or what was happening around him.</p>\n<p>Getting out of the room suddenly seemed very important. I wasn‚Äôt hungry, but it was lunchtime. Time to go. I paused in the courtyard, taking in the walls that kept the rest of Yemen out. They were mud-brick and thick, comforting but debilitating. If I didn‚Äôt go now, I never would. I thought about Molly and my mother‚Äôs voice trying to make me tough for the world to come. ‚ÄúGet back on,‚Äù she‚Äôd say each time I got bucked off. There were no hugs or comfort in those moments, just the cold insistence of a woman who knew how hard life could be. I walked out the door.</p>\n<p>On the surface, the city looked the same, drab beige buildings and the crowded market where I had bought my qat a decade earlier, but it was no longer a place I knew. The bookstore on Zubayri Street was gone, swallowed up by time, and the country was changing as well. The familiar had become foreign. What thrilled me in my twenties frightened me in my thirties. I played with my food until someone asked if I was an American.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4264324\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"176\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 128px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3513705_4264324','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/15/10/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-2706-1416066389-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Muhammad wouldn‚Äôt come in when I opened the institute gate for him and Shuaib later that afternoon.

He was mad about what happened to his brother, and I was mad about what happened to me.

I was finishing up my first story and I needed an interview. I‚Äôd already talked to his dad and brother on my trip, but it turned out that he had more information than anyone else and that he lived in Brooklyn. I suggested dinner at the Yemen Caf√© on Atlantic.</p>\n<p>I got there early and for a few minutes I just sat and listened to the chatter around me. English and Arabic, familiar and foreign, Brooklyn and Yemen. Everything was so mixed up and messy. The restaurant was different but the same. I couldn‚Äôt separate any of it.</p>\n<p>When I looked up Fahd was coming through the door with two other Yemenis. He hadn‚Äôt mentioned friends, but I didn‚Äôt want to seem like a jerk so I told them to sit down. BuzzFeed would cover the meal. They wanted to hear about my trip and what I thought of Yemen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very, very bad.‚Äù They just nodded at what they already knew and ordered for me.</p>\n<p>The restaurant was too crowded and noisy for an interview, and one of the men suggested we talk across the street in his shop. The bill had already been paid. But as soon as he pulled down the metal shutters blocking out the light and traffic from Atlantic, I knew it was a mistake. I was in Brooklyn, seven blocks from my apartment, but my body was back in Yemen, locked in a dark room with three Yemeni men. On the audio recording of the interview my voice sounds calm. I make a joke and everyone laughs, but I could feel the truth inside: jittery, full of fear, and looking for a way out.</p>\n<p>For a moment I wondered if I was going mad, then I thought about PTSD. Is that why I was shaking?</p>\n<p>Outside, Brooklyn was chilly and calm, American. I walked Fahd and his friends to the corner and thanked them for dinner. They had been gracious and hospitable, Yemeni. Three distant echoes of the country I once knew.</p>\n<p>I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. For a while I tried to read, but stories had lost their magic. There were no other worlds, only this one. And in it I did the only thing I could. I cried, facedown and helpless, on a pillow where no one could hear.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3513705_4267370\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Sign up for our BuzzReads email, and you‚Äôll get our best feature stories every Sunday ‚Äî plus other great stories from around the web!</h2>\n\n\n <div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n  \n   \n     <p>\n</p>\n<form rel:gt_cat=\"[ttp]:content\" action=\"http://buzzfeed.createsend.com/t/t/s/jiuhhh/\" method=\"post\">\n<input rel:gt_act=\"input\" id=\"fieldEmail\" name=\"cm-jiuhhh-jiuhhh\" type=\"text\" style=\"font-size:12pt; height:24px; width: 75%\" placeholder=\" your email address\" required=\"\">\n<br><br>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<input rel:gt_act=\"sign-up\" type=\"submit\" class=\"button2\" value=\"Sign Me Up!\" name=\"submitNewsletter\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"0\">\n</p>\n</form>\n   \n  \n </div>\n\n <p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://embed.contagiousmedia.com/embed/sub/sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq?uri=sign-up-for-our-buzzreads-email-and-youll-ge-nf4usc-e4xq&amp;cb=1416231318\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this embed ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 13:54:32.708055"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/gregorydjohnsen/how-i-escaped-a-kidnapping-attempt-in-yemen"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/15/12/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-14186-1416070878-3.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-16"], ["title", "My Last Day In¬†Yemen"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 13:54:32.708055"]]

The story, she wrote to BuzzFeed News, ‚Äúdumbfounded‚Äù her: It mentioned former students facing mountains of debt for their degrees, but that didn‚Äôt seem to apply to her. Brown believed that she was ‚Äúon a 100% Pell Grant through the government‚Äù and didn‚Äôt owe a cent.</p>\n<p>Everest even paid for her books and her laptop, she wrote, and sent her a stipend check every semester. ‚ÄúWill I have to pay this back or am I one of the few students being treated genuinely by Everest University?‚Äù she asked.</p>\n<p>In reality, most of what Brown believed to be a Pell Grant was actually loans: A review of documents she provided showed she owes more than $26,000.</p>\n<p>Brown, 29, who lives in Kentucky and enrolled at Everest in 2011, has yet to learn that she is going into debt for her degree. (Her last name has been changed because she is a current student.) She no longer has a phone because she is unable to pay the bills, and she sent her student loan documents from a computer at a nearby food bank where she accesses the internet. She has since been hospitalized, unreachable by phone or email.</p>\n<p>Like thousands of other students, Brown has fallen victim to a predatory lender that exploits the aspirations of the poor and disadvantaged. She had good reason to trust Everest Colleges and Universities and its representatives: It is a nationally accredited college, plugged into the government-backed student loan system that pays for the education of millions of students each year. But for thousands of desperate and financially unsophisticated students at Everest, that trust was deeply misplaced.</p>\n<p>Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs publicly traded parent company, is facing a slew of lawsuits and investigations alleging it falsified job records and misrepresented itself to students. The company is effectively being shut down by the federal government; by early next year, it will no longer own any colleges.</p>\n<p>Since July, I have heard from more than 150 current and former students who reached out to me through email, phone, text message, and Facebook after <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/this-new-lawsuit-against-everest-college-explains-why-the-go\">a story about Everest I wrote in April</a> began circulating widely among former students. The vast majority I spoke to were poor women, many of them minorities, who said they were lured to enroll with promises of jobs and good wages that would support their families. They told me they had taken out tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without understanding the extent of their debt, and sometimes not even knowing they were in debt at all. The tactics that admissions officers had used to convince them to enroll, they said, were manipulative and unethical; lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186974\">allege they were illegal</a>.</p>\n<p>By the end of their programs, students owed as much as $50,000, and few believe they will ever be able to repay even a fraction of it. Most said they graduated without jobs, then returned to unemployment or low-paying work in fast-food or retail. They used words like ‚Äúbetrayed,‚Äù ‚Äúlied to,‚Äù and ‚Äúvictimized.‚Äù Many begged for help.</p>\n<p>Corinthian, Everest‚Äôs parent company, has routinely denied most of the allegations in the many lawsuits against the company. Its spokesperson, Kent Jenkins, said that Corinthian has found employment for the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of its tens of thousands of graduates, and that the school regularly provided students with ‚Äúclear and accurate‚Äù information about the cost of their educations and the ability of credits to transfer. He denied that admissions representatives used aggressive or unethical tactics to coerce students into enrolling. Corinthian‚Äôs accreditation and job placement standards, he said, are far more stringent than those at community colleges offering similar programs.</p>\n<p>Corinthian is being sued by the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357655-cfpb-complaint-2014.html\">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> and attorneys general in <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/\">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html\">Wisconsin</a>, and faces investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and six more states, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corinthian-colleges-20140814-story.html\">criminal probe in California</a>. Earlier this year, the Department of Education reached an <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/the-government-is-finally-forcing-a-major-for-profit-college\">unprecedented agreement</a> to essentially shut down Corinthian, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>But for more than half a million current and former students, neither the shutdown nor the many lawsuits really matter. They will likely see little to no debt relief on their federal loans. They will see none of the jobs they believe they were promised. And while the company may be closing its doors, 85 of Everest‚Äôs campuses aren‚Äôt: They will be sold off, likely to other for-profit college operators or to private equity investors, and will continue to recruit and enroll students.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254424\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"386\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 338px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254424','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr02/longform-12023-1415917767-31.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The administration office entrance at Everest College in Santa Ana, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>At every step of the way, people fell prey to Everest precisely because of tactics designed to capitalize on their poverty and their trust in an accredited university. Its advertisements targeted poor and minority students, capitalizing on their desperation for jobs to get them on the phone with admissions representatives. Those salespeople used classic high-pressure tactics to sign them up for programs that were up to five times the price of similar offerings at a community college, and twice as much as a state university. One former employee called the tactics she had been taught ‚Äúbeyond deceptive and immoral.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For many students, a major life decision that was meant to lift them out of poverty has left them more deeply entrenched in it.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4253924\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-12775-1415915166-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-12775-1415915166-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"609\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 561px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4253924','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-12775-1415915166-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>If you want to see an advertisement for Everest, the best place to look is on daytime television.

In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bbFmZIdlBw\">one</a>, a young black man standing in a dark parking lot commands: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sitting on the couch, watching TV, and your life‚Äôs passing you by ‚Ä¶ You spend all day on the phone anyhow, why don‚Äôt you make a phone call that‚Äôs gonna help you in your future?‚Äù He adds, shaking his head dismissively, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs <i>easy</i>.‚Äù Another features a woman standing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12YQy0suTP4\">a freeway overpass</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_video video_youtube buzz_superlist_item_narrow video_hit no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4252305\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content c\">\n\t\n    \n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"video-embed-big video-embed-area bf_dom\" id=\"video_buzz_element_3509316_4252305\" rel:thumb=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/12YQy0suTP4/2.jpg\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"video\" : {\"size\": \"big\", \"width\":\"625\", \"height\":\"376\", \"url\":\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=12YQy0suTP4\", \"id\":\"3509316_4252305\"}}'><embed id=\"embed_3509316_4252305\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/12YQy0suTP4?version=3&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;playerapiid=embed_3509316_4252305&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"625\" height=\"376\" bgcolor=\"#000\" wmode=\"opaque\" class=\"ytvideo\"></embed></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n  </div>\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The minute those who see Everest‚Äôs commercials make that phone call, they are met with a fine-tuned sales machine intended to get them to enroll as quickly as possible. Students spoke of receiving phone calls daily, even four or five times a day. The calls didn‚Äôt end until they agreed to speak at length with an admissions representative, by phone or on campus.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives are salespeople ‚Äî the jobs are advertised as such by Corinthian, according to the California lawsuit. What they sell, though, is something much bigger than a college education, or even the promises of job placement services and $12 hourly salaries. They sell prospective students a future that many of them never imagined was possible.</p>\n<p>Students told me they felt they had no choice but to enroll. Not to do so, they said, seemed like turning down a guarantee at a better life for themselves and their families. ‚ÄúThey put on a great act saying how many jobs were available and how good I was gonna get paid,‚Äù Cacha Cherry, who graduated from Everest in 2010, wrote in an email about the first day she visited an Everest campus. ‚ÄúThey told me about people who had gotten a job and had wonderful careers and great lives ‚Äî how they were able to buy homes, go on vacations, and live this wonderful life.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Cherry had no intention of enrolling that day, but the representatives prepared papers for her to sign, despite her protests. ‚ÄúI felt pressured to sign because I wanted to make a good living for my child ‚Äî I was a young mother trying to make a better life for both of us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>A former admissions representative at Everest, one of five with whom I communicated, said Everest taught a sales tactic her supervisors called ‚Äúpeeling the onion,‚Äù appealing to students‚Äô emotions by asking them leading questions that focused on their hopes and dreams. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòHow do you think this degree will change your daughter‚Äôs life?‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow meaningful would being the first person in your family to graduate from college be?‚Äô It was all about the emotional side.‚Äù She called the enrollment tactics she was taught ‚Äúbeyond deceptive and immoral, given the circumstances of the prospective students.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs admissions representatives were under heavy pressure to sign up students ‚Äî <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1358002-2013-10k-2.html#document/p30/a186771\">until recently, they were paid based</a> in large part on how many students they enrolled, a practice that was made legal under a series of ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù laws passed by the Bush administration in 2002. Those rules were repealed by the Obama administration in 2011, but four former admissions representatives told me that their job performance was evaluated based in part on enrollment numbers.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to hit certain enrollment numbers or risk our jobs,‚Äù said another former admissions representative, who asked not to be named because his current employer is also a for-profit college. ‚ÄúSo plenty of students were enrolled that weren‚Äôt supposed to be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins denied this. Company-wide evaluation standards, the company spokesperson said, ‚Äúdo not include the number of students [admissions representatives] enroll.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Former students said Everest‚Äôs admissions office also used tactics more akin to those found in high-pressure sales environments. Many students who visited Everest‚Äôs campus for tours or simply to pick up brochures said they found themselves ushered into the enrollment and financial aid offices, bombarded by promises about job placement and encouraged to make a choice to better their futures. To get them to enroll immediately, Everest representatives often told students that they risked losing their spot in the school or that the semester was about to begin without them,‚Äù suggesting they may have to wait months or even a year before the next chance to enroll</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was considered a failure if we didn‚Äôt enroll by the end of the day‚Äù of their first visit, said the former admissions representative. Two other former admissions officers made similar assertions. If students seemed hesitant to enroll on their first visit, one representative said, administrators ‚Äúwould meet with them personally‚Äù before they left campus.</p>\n<p>Students said that as a result of the rushed, single-day process, they were given little time to read the documents they were signing. They instead trusted the word of the admissions representative who explained the documents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI remember feeling extremely overwhelmed and confused about what was happening, and by the end of the conversation, I‚Äôd basically signed up for the school and was beginning classes,‚Äù said LaShayna Bell, of Tempe, Arizona, who enrolled in 2010. ‚ÄúIt was like I blinked and missed what I‚Äôd done.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that it is ‚Äúextremely rare‚Äù for a student to enroll on the first visit, but would not specify whether that included signing preliminary paperwork. ‚ÄúWe encourage students to take their time and consider it carefully,‚Äù Jenkins said. ‚ÄúWe encourage prospective students to bring a family member or close friend on the first visit, and to ask questions about all aspects of the program.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That family member, however, sometimes turned into another opportunity for the company. Interviews with admissions representatives and former students show that Everest‚Äôs tactics were so aggressive that the school sometimes also enrolled the mothers, sisters, and spouses who accompanied prospective students on campus visits.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254607\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"835\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 787px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254607','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/17/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-15345-1415918869-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The vast majority of Everest‚Äôs students have no prior experience with college ‚Äî few relatives who attended themselves or high school counselors to help navigate the process. Sintia Lopez, a veteran, emigrated from Nicaragua when she was 12, unable to speak a word of English; she knew nobody who had ever gone to college. She believed her Everest representative when she was told that the school was one of the best in Florida, and believed the representative‚Äôs claim that the high tuition was a sign of quality education that she wouldn‚Äôt get at a community college. She didn‚Äôt know that it was abnormal for a school to call you at all hours of the day, begging you to enroll.</p>\n<p>Admissions representatives enrolled many students who were unlikely, or even unable, to succeed in college: Among those I spoke with, more than a dozen did not have a GED, including an eighth-grade dropout who was enrolled in an accounting program. Several were violent felons who could not legally be employed in the health care industry or criminal justice jobs offered by their programs.</p>\n<p>Many more appeared to be only semi-literate and were unprepared to handle college-level work. One student, who had completed a medical assistant program months after being released from jail on a felony assault charge, wrote to me: ‚ÄúI need getting loans with cleared cause I had just got out of prison and I dont a ged and they promised they would get me a job my name [redacted] please help me.‚Äù She asked not to be named because of her felony.</p>\n<p>At Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee outpost, according to allegations in the Wisconsin attorney general‚Äôs lawsuit, the campus president insisted on turning away students with criminal records who wanted to enroll in health care programs because they could not be employed in the fields they were training for. When the president left, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p9/a186623\">the suit alleges</a>, the school not only ceased using background checks, it called back those students with criminal records who had been turned away and tried to enroll them.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255025\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"396\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 348px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255025','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-mid-21160-1415922102-1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A promotional mailing sent to prospective students, which was included in the complaint by Wisconsin‚Äôs attorney general. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Wisconsin Attorney General / Via <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/complaint-corinthian-colleges-20141027.pdf\">wordpress.com</a></span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Everest voluntarily closed the Wisconsin campus two years after its opening, acknowledging it had problems.

Her boss, the admissions representative said, told her to ‚Äúput them through anyway‚Äù and ensure they sat in the class for at least five days, enough time for the school to collect their government funding.

Everest told her she was very likely to get one paying $14 an hour in her field of study, medical assisting ‚Äî a nine-month certificate degree program for which she would pay $16,400. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs money I can‚Äôt really afford,‚Äù Roberts told me. ‚ÄúBut I feel like this is the only thing I got.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Roberts, her husband, and their three elementary school‚Äìaged children live on the $8-an-hour salary her husband makes as a laborer in a nearby salvage yard, renting a small, sparsely furnished home from her husband‚Äôs boss. (Her name was changed because she is a current student.) Roberts‚Äô son, who is on the autism spectrum, is homeschooled because of his frequent and sometimes violent outbursts, and she is counting on a night job at a hospital so she can stay home with him. Her 11-year-old niece moved in with the family in September.</p>\n<p>If she doesn‚Äôt get a job, Roberts said, ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. We‚Äôre counting on this for a lot of reasons. We‚Äôre completely counting on it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But Roberts is already worried. In her last two months at Everest, she has had seven teachers for a single medical assistant course. She tallies them off on her fingers: Most quit, one saying she‚Äôd never been paid, several moved, others disappeared with no explanation. ‚ÄúWe show up and they‚Äôre gone,‚Äù she said. Instead of normal good-byes at the end of class, she said, students say to teachers, ‚ÄúHope we see you tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations in the many lawsuits against Corinthian Colleges paint a grim picture of the likelihood that Roberts will get the medical assistant job she says she was promised.</p>\n<p>To encourage students to enroll, Corinthian routinely <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186739\">told prospective students</a> that they had job placement rates of 70%, often as high as 90%. But those were ‚Äúsubstantially and materially false,‚Äù according to allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit: In <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p27/a186740\">one example</a>, a 72% placement rate was in fact 23%.</p>\n<p>In its lawsuit, the California attorney general‚Äôs office alleges that just a tiny fraction of the jobs Everest claimed it had placed students in, often around 30%, could be <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p13/a186748\">fully verified</a>. Most job placement records were ‚Äúmissing,‚Äù and for those records that could be found, the company routinely counted short-term positions as ‚Äúcareers‚Äù or included jobs that students were working outside of the fields they had trained for. One example <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p29/a186749\">cited in the suit</a> were dozens of students whose ‚Äúcareers‚Äù consisted of placements at health-screening fairs that lasted just two days.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn some cases,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357649-californiacomplaint2013-2.html#document/p10/a186746\">the California suit reads,</a> ‚Äúthere is no evidence that a single student in a program obtained a job during the time frame specified.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Allegations about falsified and misleading job placement rates are also at the center of the federal lawsuit, as well as suits in Wisconsin and Massachusetts and investigations in six other states. The lawsuit in Wisconsin alleges that in 2011, the actual job placement rate at Everest‚Äôs Milwaukee campus, which the company voluntarily shut down in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357657-wisconsin-complaint-2014.html#document/p14/a3\">was 5.5%</a>.</p>\n<p>Corinthian <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html\">strongly disputes</a> these allegations, saying that the ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù of Everest‚Äôs graduates find a job in their field. The company argues that the standards used to verify jobs in the Massachusetts suit, requiring job placements to be long-term, are <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357170-cci-response-to-ma-attorney-general-lawsuit.html#document/p3/a186753\">not reflected in state law</a>. In the California suit, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357171-cci-response-to-california-attorney-general.html#document/p20/a186756\">Corinthian said</a>, the state selectively pulled from emails and internal documents to create ‚Äúout-of-context‚Äù and ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù impressions of the company‚Äôs job placement rates.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe have a vested interest in helping our graduates succeed in the job market,‚Äù said Jenkins. He added that Everest‚Äôs accreditation is tied to its ability to prove that its students are placed in jobs: It must submit job placement statistics and records to the school‚Äôs accrediting body.</p>\n<p>The lawsuits against the company <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p26/a186759\">allege</a> that those numbers, too, were falsified.</p>\n<p>Students told me that Everest‚Äôs advertised job placement programs were limited to things like reviewing resumes and, in many cases, were all but nonexistent. Several students said that Everest staff had simply forwarded them Craigslist postings or referred them to classified ads in local newspapers. Many said they had been placed in temporary jobs, called ‚Äúexternships,‚Äù which were pre-arranged with employers and lasted anywhere from a few days to months. But once they graduated and the temporary internships the school had placed them in were over, students said, they were unable to get back in touch with job placement staff.</p>\n<p>For Mary Parks, who graduated from Everest in January, Everest‚Äôs ‚Äújob placement services‚Äù were limited to a single emailed job opportunity, a non-management internship at the retailer where she was already a cashier. After she told the school that she didn‚Äôt get the job, ‚ÄúI have not seen or heard from them since,‚Äù she said, despite emails to her caseworker. Parks has an associate degree in business management that cost $34,000, but is working a part-time job that pays just above minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Corinthian said it employs 600 career counselors for its 70,000 students, and that an internal corporate verification team checks the company‚Äôs job placement claims. ‚ÄúWe know of no traditional college or university that has made a remotely comparable commitment to career services,‚Äù said Jenkins. Community colleges generally have much lower graduation rates and lower employment rates, and employ just a handful of career counselors per 1,000 students.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said that the company ‚Äúdoes not promise employment to students, period,‚Äù and does not directly provide students with information about salaries, instead referring them to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>Somehow, however, more than 50 students who contacted me came away from Everest with the impression that they had been ‚Äúpromised‚Äù jobs that they did not receive. Allegations in the Massachusetts lawsuit against Corinthian back up the students‚Äô assertions: The <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p3/a186613\">suit alleges</a> ‚ÄúCorinthian employees promised or guaranteed employment despite knowing it could not fulfill such promises.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, the country‚Äôs biggest for-profit college lobbying group, argues that even if they fail to immediately find well-paying jobs after graduation, students leave Everest and other for-profit schools better off than when they entered: At least they have a degree or certification, and thus a chance at a better job.</p>\n<p>But an overwhelming majority of the students that I spoke to believe the opposite: They said, often fiercely, that they wished they had never enrolled.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was the worst decision of my life,‚Äù said Christine Gillan, who is $12,000 in debt for a medical assistant certificate she received in 2009. She never found a job in her field and now works as a cleaner at a health club.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad that I worked so hard and have nothing to show for it,‚Äù said Tiffany Jones, a mother of four who graduated from an Everest program in medical billing in Reseda, California, last year, but never found a job in her field. Jenkins, the Corinthian spokesman, said the school had made several efforts to reach out to Jones, which she did not respond to, and had ultimately helped her set up a job interview. Her experience, he said, ‚Äúdemonstrates that employers value an Everest education and were willing to interview her.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At that interview, Jones said, the employer asked her why she had wasted her money on an Everest education instead of a different, cheaper school. She didn‚Äôt get the job.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255438\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:description=\"‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3509316_4255438\" rel:via=\"molly_hc  \" rel:sub_title=\"‚ÄúI%20have%20nothing%20to%20show%20my%20children%20about%20why%20staying%20in%20s\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:19\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3509316_4255438\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3509316_4255438\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:19\" rel:count=\"7\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"\" style=\"font-family: 'News Cycle'; font-weight: 700; line-height: 1.5000000000000004em; font-size: 28px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #224178; \">‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù one former student said. ‚ÄúI feel so taken advantage of.‚Äù</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúI have nothing to show my children about why staying in school is so important,‚Äù Jones said. ‚ÄúMy husband and I are still struggling to keep food on the table, a roof over our heads, and our bills paid.

Everest <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p18/a186760\">consistently tells students</a> it is a ‚Äúnationally accredited school,‚Äù and many students assume that means their credits are transferable; some students said they were specifically told that their credits would transfer. But while Everest is nationally accredited, almost all nonprofit schools have regional accreditations, and accept few, if any, Everest credits. Transferring in most parts of the country is all but impossible.</p>\n<p>Jenkins said students must initial a paragraph in an enrollment document stating that transferability is out of Everest‚Äôs control and that students ‚Äúshould expect credits not to transfer.‚Äù He noted that national accreditation, which is designed specifically for career programs, has more stringent standards than regional accreditation, such as job placement and graduation requirements that community colleges do not have to meet.</p>\n<p>He also pointed to a single state, Florida, where thanks to a statewide course record system, a selection of Everest‚Äôs courses are transferable to public universities.</p>\n<p>The lack of credit transferability works in Everest‚Äôs favor, interviews with former students show. Students who become dissatisfied with the school partway through their education, or who realize months into their program how expensive the degree will be, have no choice but to stay, unable to take their credits to community colleges or public schools.</p>\n<p>And if they want to further their education by getting a more advanced degree, such as an associate or bachelor‚Äôs, students said they had no choice but to return to Everest, even if they were dissatisfied with their original programs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255266\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"715\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 667px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255266','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-16107-1415924170-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Don Bartletti/Los Angeles Times / MCT</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Corinthian paid its CEO, Jack Massimino, more than $3 million in compensation last year, including a bonus of $1 million in what was the company‚Äôs worst fiscal year to date, according to SEC filings.

Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League, the nation‚Äôs largest civil rights organization, is still a director; he joined soon after the company donated $1 million to his organization in 2012. Morial is paid upwards of $60,000 a year for his service on the board. A prominent Democrat, he was the mayor of New Orleans for eight years and once sat on President Obama‚Äôs Equity and Excellence in Education Commission, which was tasked with addressing opportunities for the federal government to address educational inequality.</p>\n<p>In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Morial said, ‚ÄúI joined the Corinthian board as someone who is committed to civil rights and equal opportunity for all and who has spent a lifetime working to advance that mission‚Ä¶ As many institutions have increasingly shifted from extensive offerings of career and vocational training, a void has emerged across the country for students, especially non-traditional students, to have an opportunity to learn a trade and gain desirable workplace skills. The concept of increased vocational training to help fill this void is sound, and it absolutely must be delivered positively, ethically and within the law.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Another Corinthian director was Leon Panetta, the former secretary of defense, who sat on the board during the years of the school‚Äôs biggest growth, from 2008‚Äì2009. He left to join the Obama administration, then rejoined the board in 2013, a year after a <a href=\"http://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/for_profit_report/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\">Senate report on for-profit colleges</a> found Corinthian to be among the worst performers in the industry, with student loan default rates higher than any other publicly traded company. He left the board after just 11 weeks, <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114041/leon-panetta-quits-corinthian-colleges-why\">facing pressure from critics</a> of Corinthian. Panetta declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>While the directors oversaw the business and were paid for their time, its owners were the biggest beneficiaries of its profits. One of the company‚Äôs largest shareholders has been Graham Holdings, formerly the Washington Post Company, which also owns Kaplan Inc., an education company and for-profit college chain.</p>\n<p>And throughout its troubled final years, Corinthian was supported by industry lobbyists, most notably the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, or APSCU. APSCU has been a force in Washington politics, most notably suing the Obama administration after a 2011 attempt to regulate the for-profit college industry, forcing the administration to revise the rules, delaying implementation for three years. Corinthian, an APSCU member, would have been among the hardest hit by those rules.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, taxpayers were the company‚Äôs largest supporter. Corinthian received 83% of its revenue from tax dollars at its enrollment peak in 2010, some $1.4 billion, and has raked in about $10 billion in the past 10 years. And it is taxpayers, through the federal student loan system, who will effectively act as debt collectors, chasing Everest‚Äôs former students for payment for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4254364\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1047\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 999px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4254364','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-5840-1415924540-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">California Attorney General Kamala Harris. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Eric Risberg / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In 2007, the California attorney general filed a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357643-california2007complaint-2.html\">lawsuit</a> against Corinthian Colleges, Everest‚Äôs parent company.

As of this year, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on background, $3.4 million of that money has been paid out to 6,000 eligible students, for a total of approximately $560 each.</p>\n<p>Six years later, a new California attorney general, Kamala D. Harris, filed a new lawsuit against Corinthian that was, for the most part, indistinguishable from the first complaint, detailing the same violations, alleging that the company had materially broken every agreement made in the previous settlement. The recent federal lawsuit, and those in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, trace similar lines.</p>\n<p>The Department of Education began <a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-heightens-oversight-corinthian-colleges\">its own investigation</a> into Corinthian in January, requesting details on everything from the company‚Äôs job placement rates to financial aid practices. In June, it claimed Corinthian was taking too long to respond completely, and temporarily cut off the school‚Äôs access to the federal financial aid money that made up almost 90% of its revenue. Corinthian was so short on cash that even the 21-day delay sent them into a financial tailspin, threatening bankruptcy; the DOE eventually agreed to release the funds, but only on the condition that Corinthian would sell off or close all of its campuses within six months. The final list included only 12 schools that would be shut down; Corinthian plans to sell the other 85, likely to a private equity firm or a for-profit competitor.</p>\n<p>But the lawsuits, investigations, and even the Department of Education‚Äôs forced shutdown are unlikely to result in any real change for the vast majority of Everest‚Äôs current and former students. One of the deep ironies of Corinthian‚Äôs collapse is that there are, experts say, effectively too many victims for there to be any reasonable way to compensate them, or to actually shut down the dozens of Everest campuses. It would cost the government billions to forgive the outstanding debt of former students, and any attempt to shut down Corinthian‚Äôs schools would displace 70,000 current ones.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau seeks debt relief for students ‚Äî but only on a tiny fraction of loans, those made directly by Corinthian, not the federal loans that make up the vast majority of students‚Äô debt. Lawsuits in California, Wisconsin, and Massachusetts may provide some restitution to former students in those states, but like the 2007 settlement, would do little more than chip away at students‚Äô loan tallies.</p>\n<p>Corinthian College‚Äôs impending demise will likely work against former students, said Pauline Abernathy, the vice president of policy organization The Institute for College Access and Success. ‚ÄúThe issue is, if [the government] were to win a lawsuit, where would the money come from to compensate students?‚Äù Abernathy said.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs all but impossible that any real money will come from Corinthian. Corinthian is so cash-strapped that it has been selling off assets ‚Äî even equipment belonging to its chain of automotive schools ‚Äî just to stay afloat until it finds a buyer for its campuses. It is extremely unlikely, experts agree, that any state would be able to recover a substantial settlement from the company.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe chances are slim‚Äù that former students will ever see any kind of meaningful debt relief, said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the advocacy group Center for Responsible Lending.</p>\n<p>And because all former students signed arbitration agreements, Dundon said, they are unable to take part in class-action lawsuits in open court, and must instead take their cases to arbitration. That can be problematic because arbitration suits are difficult to file, and, in a more business-friendly environment, do not carry with them the right to appeal. ‚ÄúThe worst thing is that the process is not public, so you can‚Äôt find out what the allegations are,‚Äù said Dundon.</p>\n<p>In the years between when the two lawsuits were filed in California, Everest boomed, reaching a height of 113,000 students in 2010. That was the year immediately after the economic crisis, when students flocked to for-profit schools in search of jobs. Enrollments ‚Äî and revenues ‚Äî fell sharply beginning in 2010, and Corinthian‚Äôs stock price slid alongside it. In 2009, the company was valued at around $1.4 billion. In the wake of the Education Department‚Äôs shutdown, its shares have been trading at around 18 cents, valuing the business at $14 million ‚Äî just $2.5 million more than the asking price of Massimino‚Äôs house.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255398\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"759\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 711px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255398','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-30060-1415925325-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jose Luis Magana / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Many Everest students who contacted me had deep misconceptions about the most basic financial aspects of their expensive educations, from the amount of tuition to who was shouldering the cost of their degree. Kelli McClendon, a former student of Everest College Online, wrote: ‚ÄúI was getting $5500 financial aid. The course was only $4500. Yet I found out I still had to take out loans to pay for my classes.‚Äù The cost of McClendon‚Äôs program was actually $13,500 ‚Äî she had been told the cost for one quarter, rather than three.</p>\n<p>The students who told me that they were misled about the nature of their debts had all ostensibly gone through financial aid counseling, signing papers that listed the amount of money they were borrowing and the interest rates on their loans. That‚Äôs a government-mandated process, designed to ensure students understand the implications of the debt they are about to enter into.</p>\n<p>But interviews with former students and employees show Everest‚Äôs version of that process <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1357656-massachusetts-complaint-2014.html#document/p34/a186789\">obscured the full cost of its education</a> and sometimes even led students to believe that they were not borrowing money at all. Some said their loans were misrepresented as grants that would not have to be repaid. Students said they were given a ‚Äútuition cost‚Äù that was per quarter or per credit, apparently without explaining that distinction. Others were told they would ‚Äúpay nothing out of pocket,‚Äù or that the school would help them find ‚Äúgovernment-sector jobs‚Äù where they would not have to repay their loans.</p>\n<p>Failing to provide complete program costs to students is in violation of Corinthian‚Äôs policies, said Jenkins. ‚ÄúAny suggestion that clear information about the cost of programs is not made available to prospective students is demonstrably false,‚Äù he said. He pointed to Corinthian‚Äôs website, where, he said, ‚ÄúYou can see that anyone can visit one of our websites and get the precise cost of any program and the availability of grants and loans to cover that cost.‚Äù (<a href=\"http://www.everest.edu/campus/chesapeake/program/criminal-justice\">This</a> is the type of page most students would navigate to find out program costs.)</p>\n<p>Admissions personnel were never allowed to discuss financial aid directly with students, according to the first former admissions representative ‚Äî ‚Äúthey would fire you on the spot if you mentioned financial aid‚Äù ‚Äî but were instead told to promise students that, once they had signed initial enrollment papers, they would be given financial aid counseling. But more often than not, she said, students left that single counseling session confused about what they had signed. ‚ÄúA couple days into class, I‚Äôd often get calls from students I enrolled saying, ‚ÄòI think I took out a loan? I don‚Äôt understand, what did this mean?‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut you couldn‚Äôt answer. You could only give them the runaround and say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt have to pay it back until after you graduate.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Often, the admissions representative said, and especially with students who spoke limited English, ‚ÄúI got the impression they didn‚Äôt know what they were signing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Though they were presented with papers that would have explained the terms and amounts of the grants and loans they were taking out, many students said they were not given time to read the papers. They instead trusted the words of their financial aid counselors, who promised to ‚Äúexplain everything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One former financial aid counselor at Everest College-Phoenix said she and other representatives ‚Äúnever discussed anything about the total cost of attendance‚Äù with students. When total costs came up, students were quickly assured they would be ‚Äúcovered by financial aid.‚Äù By the end of a single phone call with online students, the financial aid counselor said, she had signed students up for tens of thousands of dollars in loans, often without the student‚Äôs full understanding of what they had agreed to.</p>\n<p>Everest educations are expensive: More than five times as expensive as a degree from a community college, and twice as expensive as a degree from a state university. The cost is no accident; it‚Äôs largely a by-product of a federal rule governing for-profit colleges, known as ‚Äúthe 90/10 rule,‚Äù which mandates that schools can draw a maximum of 90% of their revenue from federal aid money.</p>\n<p>Everest‚Äôs tuition is set at a price high enough that some students eventually max out their federal aid, forcing them to turn to other sources to pay for the final slice of their tuition, often around $5,000. Usually, that ‚Äúfunding gap‚Äù is covered by a private loan made by Everest itself, called a Genesis loan, which charges a maximum of 9.9% interest, nearly twice as much as an unsubsidized loan made by the federal government.</p>\n<p>Dozens of students said that they were not informed ahead of time that they would need to take out private loans in addition to government funding. Most said they were told within months or even weeks of graduation that they had ‚Äúrun out of funding, and that if they wanted to graduate, they would need to sign up for a Genesis loan.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Jenkins noted that less than 40% of Corinthian‚Äôs students take out private loans. ‚ÄúThis program was never intended to be and has never been a profit center,‚Äù he said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255314\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"873\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 825px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255314','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-19571-1415924718-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Paula Dougherty, who is studying business administration at Everest, lives in rural Warrior, Alabama. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Molly Hensley-Clancy for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Paula Dougherty isn‚Äôt sure how much money she‚Äôs paying for a two-year associate degree in business administration at Everest University Online; she was never told, and she never asked.

Money for groceries when her family‚Äôs food stamps run out.</p>\n<p>Dougherty is unemployed and living on $700 a month in disability payments; she has only ever had one job, as a greeter at Walmart, which lasted two months. Four hundred dollars are eaten up in rent for a bedroom in a mobile home on the outskirts of Warrior, Alabama, which she shares with her aunt, uncle, cousin, his wife, and a dozen dogs and cats.</p>\n<p>So the stipend checks Dougherty gets from Everest every semester ‚Äî essentially cash payments taken from student loans ‚Äî are more than a bonus. The payments, sometimes up to $900, have become a necessity. ‚ÄúI need them for gas and rent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre low on food and run out of stamps, we go hungry for a while. If I have one of those checks, I can go out and buy food.‚Äù</p>\n<p>What Everest calls ‚Äústipend checks‚Äù are refunds of federal loan dollars ‚Äî what is left over from the money students borrow for their educations.

For-profit colleges say they offer poor and working students things that public and nonprofit colleges cannot: job-centric degrees, flexible course schedules for single parents and full-time workers, environments geared toward older students and veterans rather than recent high school graduates.</p>\n<p>The numbers behind the industry as a whole are troubling: Just 13% of American higher-education students attend for-profit colleges, but they account for 30% of all outstanding student loans ‚Äî and almost half of student loan defaults. The graduation rate stands at 32%. But the for-profit college industry defends those figures by saying they are explained by the schools‚Äô demographics: Studies have shown poor students are less likely to graduate, and it stands to reason that they have to borrow much more too. They also frequently compare themselves to community colleges, where graduation rates are actually lower and loan default rates often equally as high.</p>\n<p>Community colleges are significantly less expensive: an average of $8,500 vs. $35,000, meaning that only 42% of community college students are forced to go into debt for two-year degrees, compared with more than 88% of for-profit college students. They borrow, on average, twice as much as community college students.</p>\n<p>The for-profit college industry has also come under fire for much more than its student borrowing and graduation rates. Corinthian is widely known as being among the worst offenders in the industry, but it‚Äôs far from alone in its record of legal action. In January, attorneys general in 12 states announced investigations into the practices of three massive publicly traded for-profits: EDMC, ITT Educational Services, and Career Education Corporation. EDMC, which recently delisted itself from the stock exchange, faced a similar investigation in 2010; the 55,000-student ITT Educational is being investigated by the SEC and sued, like Corinthian, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>\n<p>The University of Phoenix, the country‚Äôs largest and best-known for-profit, has been investigated in several different states. It <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/university-phoenix-settles-false-claims-act-lawsuit-675-million\">settled with the Justice Department</a> over its recruiting practices for $67 million in 2009, after a government review, according to the <a href=\"http://archive.azcentral.com/families/education/articles/0914apollo14.html\"><i>Arizona Republic</i></a>, ‚Äúpaint[ed] a picture of a school so hungry to enroll new students that it has threatened and intimidated its recruitment staff in meetings and e-mail, pressured them to enroll unqualified students and covered up its practices to deceive regulators.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For its part, the Obama administration has tried ‚Äî and, so far, failed ‚Äî to impose meaningful regulations on the industry. In 2011, the administration rolled out a series of so-called ‚Äúgainful-employment‚Äù regulations meant to shut down the worst-performing career college programs. Programs were required to meet one of two metrics relating to loan repayment and debt-to-income ratios. Those that failed were disproportionately for-profit college programs.</p>\n<p>Many critics of the industry actually regarded the 2011 regulations as too lax, criticizing the administration for bowing to the demands of for-profit college lobbyists. The most prominent for-profit lobby group sued the Education Department anyway, and the rules were thrown out on a technical argument that the metrics chosen by the department were arbitrary.</p>\n<p>Last week, the administration released a new version of the regulations that, though tougher than the 2011 iteration, caved in to a key lobbying demand by the for-profit college industry. Some lawmakers are skeptical the new regulations will work as hoped. ‚ÄúI do not believe that this rule will be enough to prevent bad actors in the for-profit sector from gaming the system and taking advantage of our students,‚Äù said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat, in a statement. APSCU, the for-profit college lobbying organization, has already filed a lawsuit to strike down the new attempt at regulation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3509316_4255297\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1019px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3509316_4255297','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/13/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-21817-1415925007-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A photograph of Jennifer Wilson at her graduation from Everest. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph Molly Hensley-Clancey for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Jennifer Wilson still keeps a framed portrait in her living room of herself at graduation, beaming in a cap and gown and holding a leather folder that reads ‚ÄúEverest University‚Äù against her chest. She was so happy in that moment, she said: She had finally graduated from college ‚Äî a dream she‚Äôd had since she was a teenager ‚Äî with an associate of science degree in criminal justice. She was on her way, she hoped, to a better job.</p>\n<p>But Wilson, who lives in Cape Coral, Florida, was yet to understand the extent of the debt she was carrying. ‚ÄúI had no idea how much my loans were coming to,‚Äù she said; she had been rushed through the signing process without anybody mentioning the total cost of her program. Weeks after graduation, she started getting bills for the rest of her student loan debt. The total cost of her two-year associate degree: $40,000.</p>\n<p>She would soon find her degree was essentially ‚Äúworthless,‚Äù she said, and came with none of the job placement services she‚Äôd been promised. No police departments would hire her, although she‚Äôd been told her program had a near-perfect job placement rate; it was 2010, so some blamed the economy, but others said it was because of the quality of her degree.</p>\n<p>At her local community college, Wilson learned, a similar two-year degree would have cost around $7,000.</p>\n<p>By then, the joy of that Everest cap-and-gown moment was long gone. It had begun to fade even on graduation day. As she walked off the stage that afternoon, she opened the embossed folder for a first look at her diploma; instead, she found a letter from Everest, demanding that she pay $3,000 in private loans she still owed the school. Until she paid up, she wouldn‚Äôt officially graduate or receive her diploma. With a salary of $25,000 a year, it would take her three years, and a loan from her mother, to come up with the money.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI hated myself,‚Äù Wilson said, her voice catching as she spoke.

I love you dearly.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Back in his cramped room at the nursing home, Michael Sam Sr. picked up his battered, flip-style phone and found his son‚Äôs number. He left a message.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do?‚Äù he recalled telling his son. ‚ÄúAfter all I‚Äôve done for you?‚Äù</p>\n<p>Since Michael Jr. publicly announced he was gay in February ‚Äî just days after he let his father know by text message ‚Äî Michael Sr. has been vilified in the press. In the <i>New York Times</i>, Michael Sr. came off as a callous homophobe when he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want my grandkids raised in that kind of environment. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm old school. I‚Äôm a man-and-a-woman type of guy.‚Äù When the ESPN documentary declared that Michael Sr. had ‚Äúabandoned the family‚Äù and left his mother to raise Michael Jr. and his seven siblings on her own, Michael Sr. seemed the archetype of the intolerant and absent black father.</p>\n<p>In none of these accounts did Michael Jr. come to his father‚Äôs defense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm closer to my friends than I am to my family,‚Äù Michael Jr. told the <i>T</i><i>imes</i>.</p>\n<p>But the father-son story of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. is more than a conflict over whether Michael Sr. loved and supported his son. It‚Äôs the tale of man who‚Äôs been reduced to a caricature but whose actual life was shaped by the loss of child after child, some to death and some to crime. The rift between Michael Sr. and his youngest son started long before Michael Jr. came out and stems in no small part from those family tragedies.</p>\n<p>Of course, those losses shaped Michael Jr. too, but he isn‚Äôt saying how. Through his agent and publicist, he declined numerous requests for an interview. But it‚Äôs not hard to see how, in order to succeed and perhaps just to survive, he might blame his father, fairly or not, for what happened to his family.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4240900\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1407\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1324px; top: 432px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4240900','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/11/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-32093-1415810626-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Joel Anderson/BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Michael Sr. spends most of his days at the DeSoto Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 15 miles southwest of Dallas.

He locks his drawers because someone has been stealing his snacks.</p>\n<p>He gets around in a wheelchair, having lost his ability to walk almost three years ago. He wears a gold chain around his broad neck, which bears a deep and long surgical scar that runs from the bottom of his hairline to somewhere past the neckline of his white undershirt. It‚Äôs not clear he knows exactly what ailment has left him in a wheelchair. ‚ÄúI have a hole in my neck,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I ain‚Äôt gonna die in this motherfucker. I‚Äôm getting out of here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At 55, he‚Äôs one of the youngest and most vibrant residents at the nursing home. He has a paunch and false teeth, but he still possesses the thickly muscled shoulders and arms of someone nicknamed ‚ÄúHammer,‚Äù a handle he got on the football field and in the streets. His hands still make large fists; kicking ass was a family pastime.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaaaannnn, I used to hit hard,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI taught all my sons to play football.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He often rolls his wheelchair to a shaded patio, where he goes through Kool cigarettes like some people do cups of coffee. He banters with almost everyone. Especially the women. ‚ÄúBetter quit bending that ass over like that,‚Äù he tells one of the women staffers, a smile creasing his fleshy face. The woman smiles back. If she or other women staffers are offended by his behavior, they don‚Äôt show it. At least a couple jokingly call him their boyfriend.</p>\n<p>His phone rings throughout the day, bearing calls from his children or friends named ‚ÄùFrank Tha Cook‚Äù or ‚ÄúLittle Leroy.‚Äù The conversations usually cover his health, upcoming casino trips to Louisiana, and football, particularly the Cowboys, his favorite team since he was a boy.</p>\n<p>One person who doesn‚Äôt call is Michael Jr., who kept his distance as he ascended to fame and more recently when he tumbled out of big-time football.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242159\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"319\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 271px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242159','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/13/enhanced/webdr09/longform-952-1415816911-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Michael Sam in 2013 playing for the University of Missouri. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Joe Robbins / Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>After Michael Jr. publicly came out in February, even President Obama <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2014/story/_/id/10468033/president-barack-obama-applauds-missouri-michael-sam-coming-out\">praised the announcement</a>. On May 10, the St. Louis Rams drafted him, generating more praise. But despite the fact that he had been a star at the University of Missouri, where he became Co-Defensive Player of the Year in the powerful Southeastern Conference, he was chosen late. Only seven players were selected after him. He performed well during training camp and the preseason ‚Äî but was still cut from the final roster on Aug. 30, touching off a debate about whether homophobia played a role in his release. The Cowboys signed him three days later to their practice squad, then dropped him on Oct. 21. He is now a free agent.</p>\n<p>For the nearly two months that Michael Jr. was with the Cowboys, he lived a half hour away from his father. It was the closest they‚Äôve lived to each other in about 15 years. A family friend, Sean Woods, hoped it would finally bring the men together. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, Michael Jr. ‚Äúhas to deal with his daddy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet the Michaels have exchanged only a few text messages and haven‚Äôt spoken a word to each other, a quiet that has now lasted at least several months with no end in sight. Michael Sr. has mostly kept up with the vicissitudes of his son‚Äôs career through updates on ESPN and phone calls from friends and family members.</p>\n<p>Shortly after Michael Jr. was released from the Cowboys‚Äô practice squad, Michael Sr. sent a text to BuzzFeed News: ‚ÄúHey they cut Mike.‚Äù Asked if he‚Äôd heard from his son recently, Michael Sr. texted back that Michael Jr. ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt say a word to me honer [sic] thy father.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like he was looking for an excuse to separate from us,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôre just letting him have his limelight. We‚Äôre tired of begging him to stay in the family.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the room‚Äôs walls, Michael Sr. has pinned Father‚Äôs Day cards, a corkboard with a calendar and pictures of his family, and, over his bed, a lengthy poem about angels. On a special spot on the wall ‚Äî right over his flat-screen TV ‚Äî are two pictures of Michael Jr. in his University of Missouri football uniform. Pointing at the pictures, Michael Sr. said he knew from the start that Michael Jr. would be special.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat boy, he had some big nuts,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe was big when he was born.

In 1947, he was living in Opelousas, Louisiana, when he heard on the radio about what‚Äôs generally considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_disaster#Scale_of_the_disaster\">the deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history</a>, an explosion at the Monsanto plant near Galveston, Texas. He headed right to the scene, figuring he could get work there.</p>\n<p>He loaded cotton at the Galveston wharves for a few months before landing a job at the Monsanto plant. Yes, it had blown up, killing nearly 600 people, but he could make more money there than a black man could expect almost anywhere else.</p>\n<p>He married Alberta, a fellow Opelousas native who spoke Creole, little English, and who couldn‚Äôt read or write. With their 10 children, they moved into a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home at 1732 Thompson St. in La Marque: Wesley and Alberta had a bedroom, the girls had one, and the boys had the room at the back of the house. ‚ÄúI had a white boy type of life at home,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt nothing I couldn‚Äôt have wanted and gotten.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Alberta died at 46 following ‚Äúa brief illness,‚Äù according to her obituary in the <i>La Marque Times</i>. Wesley Sam was a loving man, a capable cook, and obsessive about cleanliness ‚Äî he would dust off his car every day, his surviving children said. But he wasn‚Äôt quite up to the challenge of corralling all of those children. Who could? Instead he set his example through his work ethic, putting in a full day at Monsanto then mowing lawns with his sons in the evening.

His sister Geraldine would become La Marque‚Äôs first black mayor.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr., meanwhile, dropped out of school over the protests of his father but earned a GED. He wasn‚Äôt much of a student anyway, and finding work in the area was a cinch for anyone who didn‚Äôt mind getting a few smudges on their shirt. He worked in construction, at a chemical plant, and as a crane operator and a forklift operator.</p>\n<p>Away from work, Michael Sr. and his brothers drank, chased women, and kept up the family tradition of fisticuffs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be out in the front yard fighting,‚Äù Michael Sr. said, grinning at the memory. ‚ÄúReal fighting. Not no slapboxing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One night in 1978, Michael Sr. met a woman named JoAnn Turner at a local nightclub. ‚ÄúShe was fine and good-looking,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I walked her out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Little more than a year later, JoAnn gave birth to a boy they named Russell. A year later, they had daughter Chanel. Julian was born in June 1982. They were young and in love, with three kids and jobs that paid middle-class wages. It didn‚Äôt take long for Michael Sr. to settle into life as a family man, or long for it to be destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4241207\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"697\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 649px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4241207','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/12/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-31269-1415811985-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs a news brief from the Associated Press on Sept. 23, 1982, with a dateline from Texas City: ‚ÄúThe body of Chanel Roshaun Sam was found Monday night in about eight feet of water near a pier on which she had been playing. Her parents and neighbors searched for three hours before finding the body.‚Äù The little girl, 2 years old, had apparently drowned.</p>\n<p>After several days of grief, and desperate to rescue JoAnn from her despair, Michael Sr. suggested they go to the courthouse. And so, six days after their daughter died, they were married.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt like she needed some support,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was the right thing to do, to bring something positive from it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt enough. JoAnn turned to religion and became a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. Her conversion deepened the fissure in her marriage, because Michael Sr. was raised as a Baptist and felt his wife‚Äôs new religion was too restrictive. She insisted the family not celebrate Christmas. ‚ÄúI celebrated it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt celebrate it with me. I still bought the kids gifts.‚Äù (JoAnn didn‚Äôt respond to requests for an interview.)</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. found his solace shooting dice. On Friday and Saturday evenings, he would take his paycheck to a little wooden shack in Texas City and gamble away the family‚Äôs money. JoAnn suspected the absences were because of another woman, Michael Sr. said. But a mutual friend of the couple gave her the scoop. In Michael Sr.‚Äôs version of the story, the woman told JoAnn that ‚Äúhe ain‚Äôt screwing none of us‚Äù but was just gambling.</p>\n<p>One Friday night, Michael Sr. recalled, he won $700 and left the shack with two friends on an impromptu trip to Boy‚Äôs Town in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, an infamous red-light district just across the Texas border. He didn‚Äôt bother calling JoAnn to tell her that he was leaving town.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt no cell phones back then, and I didn‚Äôt stop and spend the 25 cents to call,‚Äù he said. When he returned Sunday, ‚Äúshe bitched at my ass. But it was pretty funny. I had a blast.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage continued to spiral, though Joshua was born in 1984 and Christopher in 1985. Michael Sr. finally filed for divorce in February 1986. A brief attempt at reconciliation resulted in the birth of Michelle in 1987. But the divorce was granted in 1988.</p>\n<p>JoAnn was awarded primary parental responsibilities. Michael Sr. would have access to the children two weekends each month, and they divided up the holidays.</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. was also ordered to pay JoAnn $250 each month for child support. Within a few months, JoAnn returned to court to complain that Michael Sr. wasn‚Äôt meeting his obligation. Thus started a four-year battle over child support. Michael Sr. was charged with contempt of court at least 10 times stemming from his failure to pay, according to court records. Twice he was sent to county jail.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4242796\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 392px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4242796','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr09/longform-12326-1415824077-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">The District Clerk's Office of Galveston County</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúIt was because I was running around and spending money and shooting dice,‚Äù Michael Sr. said.

He was breaking into the back door when the homeowner fired at him three times through a metal door. Russell was clutching a screwdriver when his body was found. No charges were filed against the homeowner (who was also black).</p>\n<p>The anger welled up within Michael Sr., who casually knew the man who had killed his son. There weren‚Äôt many strangers on that side of town. Michael Sr. got himself a handgun. ‚ÄúI was going to kill him,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI was going to go over there and end him.

He wouldn‚Äôt let me go over there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>His father saved him<i>.</i> But Michael Sr. couldn‚Äôt save his own sons.</p>\n<p>At 5 feet 4 inches and 125 pounds, second-oldest son Julian had an unusually slight build for a Sam boy. He went by the nickname ‚ÄúIce Pick.‚Äù But he had a left arm that was made for pitching. ‚ÄúThat boy could throw,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe used to strike Russell out all the time. Those were the funnest days.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But, Michael Sr. said, ‚Äúhe wanted his own money‚Äù and begged his father to let him work.

She told the newspaper that she wanted him to come home or at least call someone in the family to let them know he was OK.</p>\n<p>In grief, Michael Sr. had quit his job at the post office. ‚ÄúI had always had a steady job, but I couldn‚Äôt handle it no more,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI felt closed in. Just thinking of it.‚Äù He found work as a crane operator but was laid off soon after. He got a job working for a local pipe company and was let go again. Finally, in the fall of 1999, a family friend told him he should consider truck driving. Michael Sr. went to school in Dallas, and four months later was on the road, coming back to Hitchcock when he could, mostly on weekends.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a steady job,‚Äù he said, and one that answered a deeper need: ‚ÄúI had to get away. I wanted to get away.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The marriage crumbled. Michael Sr. and JoAnn remain legally married but haven‚Äôt lived as a couple since he moved to Dallas in 2000.</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was 10 when his father started his life on the road. With JoAnn working late hours and taking extra shifts to provide for the children, Michael Jr.‚Äôs older brothers had their run of the house ‚Äî and the streets. ‚ÄúIt was bad,‚Äù Michael Jr. said in an ESPN documentary about his life. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a kid and I‚Äôm seeing some hardcore drugs in my house. My mother didn‚Äôt know about it. If I told her anything, my brothers said they would kill me.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Craig Smith, one of his high school football coaches, saw it for himself. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôd drive over to pick him up and honk the horn and one of his brothers would come out to see if I wanted to buy‚Äù drugs, he told a crowd at the school‚Äôs annual football reunion dinner in late July.</p>\n<p>The criminal records of Michael Jr.‚Äôs brothers support these accounts: Josh has been arrested more than 40 times, including four convictions for drug possession, and Chris has tallied nearly 20 arrests.</p>\n<p>In April, Chris was sentenced to 30 years in state prison for breaking into a woman‚Äôs home, choking her into unconsciousness twice, then using her credit card at a nearby restaurant. Josh was put in the Galveston County Jail in July on a minor offense and was released last month.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI got caught up in them streets,‚Äù Josh admitted during a June interview with BuzzFeed News, a rare evening this year when he wasn‚Äôt locked up.</p>\n<p>Little of this came as a surprise to family members. Cousins remember being warned to keep their distance. ‚ÄúWe knew it wasn‚Äôt the ideal upbringing,‚Äù said Joseph Sam, a nephew of Michael Sr. ‚ÄúThey were always in trouble.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With his childhood saturated with grief and his older brothers descending into crime, Michael Jr. would have had to be a saint not to look for someone to blame. Conveniently, his father was already blaming himself.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, far away from home, Michael Sr. remained tormented by the loss of his boys. Teaching them toughness had backfired; he‚Äôd armed them with tools for survival in one world that wouldn‚Äôt work in almost any other.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLife was going to be tough on them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour skin had to be tougher than the others.

Michael Jr. wasn‚Äôt saying much to his new seatmate. The silence went on for so long and got so awkward that eventually the boy spoke up.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI told the teacher that I didn‚Äôt want to sit next to him because he was too quiet,‚Äù said Robert Dohman. ‚ÄúHe turns around and goes, ‚ÄòHey, blondie boy, I‚Äôm not quiet!‚Äô And that‚Äôs the way me and Michael get along now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Jr. was voted ‚Äúfriendliest‚Äù by his sixth-grade classmates and elected homecoming king in eighth grade. His popularity was a testament to his ability to navigate the unspoken color line of a small Southern town; most of his close friends were white.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy grandma,‚Äù said Dohman, ‚Äúwas very old-school and wasn‚Äôt into all that racial mixing. But when I had Michael over, he‚Äôd always be the first one to come over and give everybody a hug. Even her. He really changed the way my grandmother looked at black people. She would even smile when he came around.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he saw little of the outgoing side of his son, saying he was quiet at home. But coaches and teachers remember him as a precociously self-assured teenager who could start a conversation with anyone. After football games, Michael Jr. was known for going into the bleachers ‚Äî uniform and pads still on ‚Äî to introduce himself to parents.</p>\n<p>Michael could ‚Äútalk to a group of 15-year-olds and then set there and talk to a group of 55-year-olds and not feel out of place either,‚Äù said Smith, now head football coach at Hitchcock. ‚ÄúI just never had a student that could just go and talk to a group of people. He would make friends all the time.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even in what was ostensibly enemy territory. Smith recalled a track meet at Danbury, a nearby town that is 90% white, less than 1% black, and had developed a reputation for being unfriendly to minorities. Except, apparently, Michael Jr.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can remember some Danbury parents cheering and rooting for Michael running the 100-meter‚Äù dash, Coach Smith said. ‚ÄúYou just didn‚Äôt see that, if you know anything about Danbury.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Maybe the biggest benefit of playing sports is that it kept Michael Jr. away from his brothers. The coaches, who also worked as teachers in the district, knew all about Josh and Chris: Their obvious athleticism had never proven to be worth the trouble. But Michael Jr. was charting a path different from the men in his family. Michael Jr. greeted people with hugs, not fists. He was going to be the first to graduate.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMichael was a good kid,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúHe said he didn‚Äôt want to be like his brothers.‚Äù Left unsaid was that Michael Jr. clearly felt the same about his father.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243125\" rel:buzz_num=\"13\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:13\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243125','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/16/enhanced/webdr09/longform-original-27645-1415829145-39.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Robert Dohman</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>On fall Friday nights, Michael Sr. said he would find a seat somewhere in Hitchcock‚Äôs football stadium, away from the crowd and sometimes with his father, Wesley. After nearly 30 years as a father, he said, he could finally engage in the autumn ritual familiar across Texas.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt miss [any] home game his senior year,‚Äù Michael Sr. insisted.</p>\n<p>There isn‚Äôt anyone who can corroborate his perfect attendance. Family and friends say they‚Äôre sure he went to some games but don‚Äôt know about all of them. The coaches at Hitchcock High can remember seeing or, rather, hearing, Michael Sr. only once in four years: a game in Michael Jr.‚Äôs sophomore year.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI heard this guy yelling at Michael and I turned to Michael and asked him, ‚ÄòWho the hell is that guy?‚Äô‚Äù Smith recalled. ‚ÄúMichael said it was his father. That‚Äôs the only time I‚Äôve ever seen him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Those stadiums can be hubs of activity on Friday nights, and coaches are notoriously focused on the events unfolding well away from the stands. It would be easy to miss someone on game night, <i>right</i>?</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLet me say this in a nice way,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know him, and I know a lot of people in town. I can look up in those stands and know who‚Äôs there.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he didn‚Äôt make it a priority to spend any time with the parents of Michael Jr.‚Äôs friends or the alums and other regulars who would show up at school events ‚Äî most of them white. ‚ÄúI never did know them,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúAnd I never tried to go out of my way.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he took a job with a trucking company based out of Ada, Oklahoma, so that he could arrive in Hitchcock by the start of kickoff Friday night. He assumed his son appreciated what he considered a significant sacrifice of time and money; coming back to Texas without a load meant he wouldn‚Äôt get paid for the drive home.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until earlier this year, when media outlets began saying that he had abandoned his son, that Michael Sr. learned he was being phased out of the story of his son‚Äôs childhood. He never thought all those years on the road would mean that he wasn‚Äôt there.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMichael‚Äôs family was the city of Hitchcock,‚Äù said Dohman, Michael Jr.‚Äôs childhood friend.</p>\n<p>Told what Dohman said, Michael Sr. looked straight ahead, the anger washing over him. Sitting on that patio at the nursing home, he was, for a few moments, that angry Sam boy ready to fight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock didn‚Äôt buy his goddamn clothes, a roof over his head, or the bed that he slept in,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúThe city of Hitchcock can kiss my ass.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúI should have kept those gas receipts.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Of course, Michael Sr. never thought he would need them. He also never thought the family of a high school teammate ‚Äî a white one ‚Äî would get so much credit.</p>\n<p>Once Michael Jr. revealed in February his plans to become the NFL‚Äôs first out gay player, the two media outlets with which his publicists coordinated the announcement wrote this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/sports/football/for-nfl-prospect-michael-sam-upbringing-was-bigger-challenge-than-coming-out-as-gay.html?_r=1\">The <i>New York Times</i></a>: Sam found a comfortable place off the field as well, in large part because of Ethan Purl, a classmate and the son of Ron Purl, the president of the local branch of Prosperity Bank. Ron‚Äôs wife, Candy, made sure their house was part recreation center and part counseling hub for their children and their friends. By Sam‚Äôs senior year, he had his own bedroom in the Purls‚Äô house, along with chores like cleaning the pool and carrying the grocery bags. ‚ÄúI look at our house as a kind of safe haven,‚Äù said Ron Purl, who keeps a photograph of Sam in his Missouri football uniform in his office. ‚ÄúHe is just another son. If he did something wrong, he got yelled at just like the others did.‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/10453954/michael-sam-safe-havens-football-surrogate-family\">ESPN</a>: The relationship started when Candy Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs wife, invited Michael to dinner during his freshman year of high school. Ronnie, a man with a personality much bigger than he is, discovered a kid he didn‚Äôt recognize and demanded to know, ‚ÄúAnd who are you?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWithout skipping a beat, my brother replied, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Michael Alan Sam Jr.!,‚Äô‚Äù said Ethan Purl, Ronnie‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúAnd after that, he never left.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bunch of shit,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. Sure, he said, his son went to the Purls‚Äô on weekends, but ‚ÄúMichael lived at home to the day he graduated.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe lived with the rest of us,‚Äù agreed Michael Jr.‚Äôs sister Michelle.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Purls only helped [him] in [his] senior year,‚Äù his aunt Geraldine said. ‚ÄúIf the Purls were really good people, they‚Äôd tell Michael that he was wrong. That he should acknowledge his mother and daddy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>After a brief phone conversation in which he said he didn‚Äôt have time to speak, Ethan Purl did not return repeated phone calls. Ronnie Purl declined a number of interview requests. ‚ÄúWithout Michael‚Äôs approval I will not be able to speak with you,‚Äù he said in an email. ‚ÄúBeing in banking, I am very aware of privacy issues.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. said he met the Purls at least once, when he accompanied Michael Jr. on one of his visits over there.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI just wanted to see where Michael was going, to make sure where he was going was the right environment,‚Äù Michael Sr. said.</p>\n<p>In fact, Michael Sr. liked that his youngest son had white friends.

How else to explain Vito coming home for the holidays? Michael Sr. waited until they returned to Missouri to broach his suspicions to his wife. ‚ÄúI told JoAnn, ‚ÄòYou know, Mike ain‚Äôt bring his girlfriend but he brought this dude. That‚Äôs kinda funny,‚Äô‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúBut she swore up and down‚Äù that he wasn‚Äôt gay. ‚ÄúI kept asking Mike was this boy funny? ‚ÄòNo, Daddy, no.

I told my brother that that boy right there is gay.‚Äù</p>\n<p>When they went out for dinner later that night, Michael Jr. showed them a picture of a woman he said he was dating; Michael Jr.‚Äôs Instagram account has lots of pictures of him in college posing with young women.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI still had some suspicions,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. But other family members ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna believe it. I had intuition about that boy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That intuition was finally confirmed this year. On Feb. 4, Michael Sr.‚Äôs birthday, he received a text message from his son. ‚ÄúI could tell his PR guy wrote that message because Mike don‚Äôt talk like that,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was some bullshit. ‚ÄòI wanted to inform you that I‚Äôm gay.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got to say?‚Äù Michael Sr. remembered texting Michael Jr. in response. ‚ÄúHe texted me back, ‚ÄòHappy birthday.‚Äô So I went out and got drunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Five months later, in his room at the nursing home watching the red carpet show before his son would receive the Arthur Ashe Award, Michael Sr. grew wildly upset. He started calling and texting family members and friends.</p>\n<p>With Vito at his side, Michael Jr. had been asked what was the most difficult part of coming out. He told the interviewer that it was telling his friends. Michael Sr. was incensed.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf it was so hard to tell his friends, why didn‚Äôt he tell us first?‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúIt was harder for him to tell us.‚Äù</p>\n<p>And it probably was. One recent afternoon, Michael Sr.‚Äôs brother Charles asked if Michael Jr. might go back to women. Michael Sr. responded, ‚ÄúWomen don‚Äôt really want to mess with you after doing all that gay shit.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Sr. is never going to be the spokesman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. He‚Äôs not thrilled about his son‚Äôs sexual orientation. But he also hasn‚Äôt disowned his son. He never says his son is going to hell. He doesn‚Äôt talk about trying to cure him or make him straight. In his own rough-hewn, coarse way, Michael Sr. has accepted that his son is gay. ‚ÄúI love my son,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I don‚Äôt care about what he do.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243564\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 388px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243564','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-12096-1415822894-12.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Buckner / Getty Images For ESPYS</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The family rift that the ESPY Awards exposed to a national audience had been there, deep and wide, for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243442\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 302px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243442','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr01/longform-24319-1415822500-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Will Ebner </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://L.G\">L.G</a>.

Instead of asking his family to attend as guests, he invited the family of Missouri football teammate Will Ebner.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe found out Will and I were going to be part of his family representing him,‚Äù said Elaine Ebner, mother of Will Ebner. ‚ÄúIf someone else had come from his family, I would have wanted them to be center stage. I know my place. Mainly, I just wanted to be whatever he wanted me to be.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Michael Jr.‚Äôs aunt Geraldine managed to score tickets from a friend who was a member of the Rotary Club. She also sat in the area designated for family. ‚ÄúWhen I got there, [Michael Jr.] was glad to see me. It‚Äôs always good to have family there,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Days later, Michael Jr. graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in parks, recreation, and tourism. Everyone in the family ‚Äî except Josh and Chris, who were both in jail ‚Äî made the 600-mile road trip from Texas to celebrate the first of JoAnn‚Äôs and Michael Sr.‚Äôs children to graduate from college.</p>\n<p>To commemorate the occasion, Michael Jr. <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/h6w1JOG8Zk/?modal=true\">posted a picture on Instagram</a> of himself in a cap and gown, a wide smile on his face and an elbow comfortably resting on the mantle of a fireplace. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming,‚Äù read his caption. He was alone in the photo and made no mention of anyone else being there ‚Äî in that or any of his other public social media posts from the time.</p>\n<p>Later in December, during the week of the Cotton Bowl in Dallas ‚Äî Michael Jr.‚Äôs final college game ‚Äî Michael Sr. said his son borrowed his car and spent all of his time with Vito and teammates. Michael Sr. also said his son lied to him about the location of the team hotel and then didn‚Äôt call him, or return any of his calls, for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had to call him to get him to bring me my car back,‚Äù Michael Sr. said. ‚ÄúI kept calling and calling. He didn‚Äôt bring the car until the last day, and the game was the next day. He didn‚Äôt talk to me or nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In May, on the weekend of the NFL draft, Michael Jr.‚Äôs family was conspicuously absent when TV cameras followed him around at his agent‚Äôs home in San Diego. He declined an offer from his father‚Äôs family members to attend a draft party they wanted to host in Dallas, his aunt Geraldine and Michael Sr. said. Instead, he spent the weekend in California with Vito, some friends, and his agents.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs so ashamed of us,‚Äù Geraldine remembers one of his sisters telling her, ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt he just change his name?‚Äù</p>\n<p>The day the Rams drafted him ‚Äî when he was so happy that he kissed Vito and smeared his face with celebratory cake ‚Äî might end up being the pinnacle of Michael Jr.‚Äôs NFL career. Now, cut from his second team, he is learning something his father learned long ago: Life can take what you want most.</p>\n<p>Since 2000, <i>Outsports</i> noted, every single Defensive Player of the Year from the five major college football conferences made it onto an NFL team ‚Äî except Michael Sam Jr. And it‚Äôs not that he played poorly in preseason. Far from it. He totaled 11 tackles and three sacks, a figure that left him tied for fourth in the league. His bold announcement of his sexuality, which garnered him glamorous accolades, may have also destroyed his football career.</p>\n<p>Disappointment and loss are feelings Michael Sr. knows well, of course, so the two Michaels have more in common now than they may have ever had. And yet Michael Jr. doesn‚Äôt come to his father ‚Äî or anyone in his family ‚Äî for comfort. He keeps his distance.</p>\n<p>To Michael Sr., sitting in his wheelchair or taking a drag on one of his Kools, that distance can feel like death. He doesn‚Äôt want to lose another son.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508884_4243647\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"441\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 393px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508884_4243647','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/12/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-32388-1415823783-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Dylan Hollingsworth for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 13:55:26.785237"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/joelanderson/the-two-michael-sams"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-15738-1415729730-34.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-13"], ["title", "The Two Michael¬†Sams"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 13:55:26.785237"]]

For his crime, Robert Braxton Jr. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">served</a> two years in prison.</p>\n<p>In court, prosecutors presented no evidence that Hall herself had harmed the child. But for failing to intervene against Braxton‚Äôs abuse, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">was sentenced</a> to 30 years behind bars.</p>\n<p>Her tough sentence was meted out despite evidence that Braxton had also been violently abusing her. In statements to authorities <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">in</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">out</a> of court, and in a recent interview with BuzzFeed News, Hall described Braxton choking her, punching her, throwing things at her, and verbally assaulting her. Even the judge who sentenced her <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">said</a> that during her testimony, Hall seemed to fear her boyfriend.</p>\n<p>Hall is one of 28 mothers in 11 states who a recent <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/how-the-law-turns-battered-women-into-criminals#1u8oxdk\">BuzzFeed News investigation</a> found were sentenced to 10 years or more for failing to protect their children. In <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin\">every one</a> of these cases, there was evidence the mother herself had been violently abused by the man. Hall is one of three cases BuzzFeed News found in which the mother got <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">a longer sentence</a> than the man who actually abused the child.</p>\n<p>Braxton walked free eight years ago, having been <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p4/a186105\">let go for time served</a>. Meanwhile, Hall has been locked up in an all-female prison in McLoud, Oklahoma. She said that she has seen her children only once since she went to prison but that they write each other monthly. In letters shared with BuzzFeed News, the children tell her about sports, school, and clothes. They make reference to her case, too. ‚ÄúI hope God Let‚Äôs [sic] you out of jail,‚Äù one letter says.</p>\n<p>Hall has been trying to get her sentence reduced. She currently has <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=542749&amp;offender_book_id=323174\">20 years left</a> behind bars. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed but lost</a>, and the trial judge in her case has <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied a request</a> to modify her sentence. She will not be eligible for parole until 2030.</p>\n<p>But she is pursuing one last hope: clemency. Earlier this month, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html\">applied</a> for her sentence to be commuted ‚Äî which would release her while not absolving her of her crime.</p>\n<p>In the wake of BuzzFeed News‚Äô original investigation, a women‚Äôs rights organization <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/meet-the-abuse-victim-who-got-30-years-in-prison-and-the-fem\">took up Hall‚Äôs cause</a>, creating an <a href=\"http://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/tondalo_hall/?source=uv_website\">online petition</a> to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. ‚ÄúTondalo Hall shouldn‚Äôt be in prison while the man who abused her and her children is free,‚Äù wrote <a href=\"http://www.weareultraviolet.org/\">UltraViolet</a>, a group that claims nearly 600,000 members nationwide. On Tuesday, an UltraViolet official said that more than 44,000 people had signed the petition since it was first circulated on Nov. 6.</p>\n<p>In Oklahoma, a pardon or commutation cannot be granted without the approval of the state‚Äôs parole board. It is unclear when the parole board will make a decision on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n<p>Hall herself almost missed the deadline to apply for a commutation. In Oklahoma, only inmates with 20 or more years left on their sentences can apply. When she mailed her application, Hall had 20 years and five days left behind bars.</p>\n<p>Another Oklahoma mother, Alishia Mackey, also received a longer sentence than the abuser, and the victim, her son, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/mothers-imprisonment-leads-rape-victim-to-wish-he-had-never\">believes she should be free</a>. But Mackey has 10 years left on <a href=\"http://docapp065p.doc.state.ok.us/servlet/page?_pageid=394&amp;_dad=portal30&amp;_schema=PORTAL30&amp;doc_num=489054&amp;offender_book_id=286204\">her sentence</a>, so she is ineligible for a commutation.</p>\n<p>The parole board declined to comment on Hall‚Äôs case.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231377\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"438\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 390px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-27050-1415727045-14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall, Oklahoma Department of Corrections</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Some prosecutors defend the long sentences given to battered women who don‚Äôt intervene to stop their children from being harmed as sending a message that mothers have a duty to protect their children, even if they must risk their own safety. But many domestic violence advocates women counter that such punishments blame the victim and demonstrate a profound misunderstanding of what it means for women to be trapped in abusive relationships. Such women often fear alerting authorities because doing so can provoke their partners to extreme violence and because the authorities often fail to protect battered women and their children.</p>\n<p>Hall, who dropped out of high school in 10th grade, told BuzzFeed News that she met Braxton in either 2000 or 2001, when she would have been between 15 and 17. They soon began dating, and Braxton, who is two years older than Hall, seemed ambitious and nice ‚Äî in the beginning.</p>\n<p>She can‚Äôt quite remember what it was that set him off the first time: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell him where I went, or something,‚Äù she recalled. They got into an argument, she said, and he punched her in the face.</p>\n<p>He apologized, she recalled, and said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again, and it didn‚Äôt, for a while at least. But then, during another argument, this time when she was pregnant, he put his hands around her throat. ‚ÄúHe told me that my mouth was too smart,‚Äù she would later <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p55/a186122\">testify in court</a>. With her head on the seat of the blue couch in her apartment, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186120\">he choked her</a>.</p>\n<p>The abuse, both physical and verbal, picked up once her third child (and second with Braxton) was born in August 2004, Hall told BuzzFeed News. He isolated her from her loved ones, driving ‚Äúa wedge between me and my family,‚Äù she said.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">summed up</a> the alleged abuse in her commutation application: ‚ÄúRobert regularly choked me, blackened my eyes, threw objects at me and verbally assaulted me, while my children were in the home.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Somewhere along the way, Hall‚Äôs friend Gayla Watts-Sparger noticed changes in Hall and her children. Watts-Sparger has known Hall since kindergarten and said Hall was always goofy and outgoing. ‚ÄúYou know how you meet somebody, and everything they say is funny?‚Äù Watts-Sparger said.</p>\n<p>But after Hall moved in with Braxton, Hall became ‚Äúa lot quieter,‚Äù Watts-Sparger said, and Hall‚Äôs children acted strange too. Watts-Sparger recalled seeing Hall‚Äôs son, who was maybe a year old at the time, sitting upright and very still for a young child. When Braxton came by, Watts-Sparger said, the young boy would flinch.</p>\n<p>Reached through his Facebook account, Braxton at first said he would speak with BuzzFeed News but then did not respond to subsequent messages. After BuzzFeed News left repeated voicemails and sent a detailed letter to Braxton‚Äôs address given in court papers, a woman identifying herself as ‚ÄúMs. Braxton‚Äù called and said that Robert Braxton does not live there and that she doesn‚Äôt know where he is.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2004, Hall said, she noticed that her 20-month-old son‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p45/a186123\">leg was swollen</a>. Braxton told her he didn‚Äôt know what might have happened. The problem persisted for several days, so she brought the boy to the hospital.</p>\n<p>Doctors determined <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186124\">he had</a> a fractured femur and other broken bones. Suspecting child abuse, authorities checked on Hall and Braxton‚Äôs 3-month-old daughter, and found similar injuries. Both Hall and Braxton were arrested.</p>\n<p>Detectives at the Oklahoma City Police Department brought them both into the same interview room. Before the interrogation, Braxton <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p77/a186125\">was heard whispering to Hall</a>, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say nothing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">initially told</a> the police that she had hurt their son by throwing him on the bed as they were playing ‚Äî a version she later said was a lie. After Braxton admitted he had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355439-braxton-tells-detective-that-he-squeezed-his.html#document/p1/a186129\">squeezed his baby daughter too tightly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186128\">cranked her leg</a>, detectives <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355429-detective-lorre-freeman-testimony-at-a-court.html#document/p2/a186476\">concluded</a> that he was the one who had injured both children, not her.</p>\n<p>Hall remained in jail, though. She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p17/a186108\">pled guilty</a> to enabling child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. She agreed to testify against Braxton ‚Äî though she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p62/a186126\">did not receive a deal</a> from prosecutors for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p>Braxton took his case to trial. Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186131\">wrote</a> in her commutation application that Braxton ‚Äúrepeatedly threatened me‚Äù during their initial court hearings. ‚ÄúFor example, when Robert and I were being shuttled to and from court he would terrorize me. He would tell me that I would spend the rest of my life in prison and he would be out with our children.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Still, Hall agreed to testify against him. During Braxton‚Äôs trial, she was the main witness who could have seen Braxton actually harming the children. Yet Hall could not point to any specific abuse that she witnessed ‚Äî because, she told BuzzFeed News, she didn‚Äôt actually see any abuse happen. In court, she also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p46/a186139\">couldn‚Äôt recall</a> the date her son began having trouble walking.</p>\n<p>Prosecutor Angela Marsee grew frustrated that Hall was not providing enough testimony to nail Braxton. ‚ÄúWhat do you know?‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186136\">she asked</a>.</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p51/a186140\">replied</a> that she had once woken up to hear that her daughter was screaming. Braxton had been changing the girl‚Äôs diaper. He told her nothing was wrong and that she should go back to sleep.</p>\n<p>The prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">asked for more</a>. ‚ÄúWas there anything else that happened in your apartment that gave you reason to know that your children were in danger at the hands of this defendant?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù Hall replied. That‚Äôs when she began to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p54/a186141\">describe</a> the time that Braxton had choked her, when she was pregnant. Yet Braxton‚Äôs lawyer <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p57/a186142\">objected</a> to this line of questioning, saying it was not relevant to the child abuse charge against him. The judge sided with Braxton.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p24/a186144\">wanted</a> life in prison for Braxton, sensed that their case against him <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">was crumbling</a>. With the trial in recess, the state and the defense worked out a deal. Braxton pled guilty but <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p11/a186106\">admitted</a> to having harmed only one child. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303337-ok-robert-braxton-plea-statement-of-facts.html#document/p1/a178180\">said</a> he grew frustrated while changing his daughter‚Äôs diaper and then broke her bones by ‚Äúusing too much force and pressure for a baby.‚Äù He was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p10/a186433\">sentenced</a> to 10 years in prison ‚Äî but eight of those years were suspended, and he was released for time served.</p>\n<p>Hall was upset with the verdict. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt feel like there was any justice for my kids,‚Äù she told BuzzFeed News.</p>\n<p>Someone else was also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">upset</a> with the trial‚Äôs outcome: Marsee, the prosecutor.

They also interviewed Hall‚Äôs cousin, who <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186148\">took custody of her three children</a>. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186146\">According to the report</a>, the cousin stated that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p4/a186157\">was a good mother</a> but that Braxton was very controlling, kept Hall away from her family, and did not want the boys to be kissed or hugged because doing so would make them a ‚Äúpunk.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The report noted that Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186151\">was</a> 22 years old, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p9/a186149\">had no prior arrests</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186150\">suffered</a> from depression. The report recommended a ‚Äúsplit sentence,‚Äù which means some time in prison and some on probation. If released to probation, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355349-hall-presentence-report.html#document/p10/a186152\">the officers said</a>, ‚ÄúShe would be supervised as a low-level offender.‚Äù Marsee, the prosecutor in both the Braxton and Hall cases, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p22/a186109\">said in court</a> that she had no issues with any of the facts in the report.</p>\n<p>Hall‚Äôs sentencing hearing began <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p20\">on Dec. 20, 2006</a>, two weeks <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p13/a186153\">after</a> Braxton was released. Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p26/a186143\">called</a> for Hall to spend ‚Äúa significant portion of the rest of her life‚Äù in prison. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs their mother,‚Äù Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p27/a186154\">told the court</a>. ‚ÄúShe is the one person in this world who should be standing up for them,‚Äù she said, yet ‚Äúthey were in pain because of what she didn‚Äôt do, and she should pay for that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Marsee also had another reason for recommending a long sentence: Hall, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186110\">she declared</a>, was part of the reason the case against Braxton ‚Äúfell apart.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe definitely should have received a more significant sentence,‚Äù Marsee <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186111\">told the court</a>, ‚Äúbut because of her minimizing and continuing to protect herself and protect him, that had a real impact on what we were able to do with him in the jury trial. So she should not benefit from that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In response, Hall‚Äôs attorney Bill Smith pointed to the choking incident. ‚ÄúShe was scared of Robert Braxton,‚Äù Smith <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p30/a186112\">told the court</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p28/a186155\">asked</a> that she receive the same sentence as Braxton.</p>\n<p>When it came time for Judge Ray Elliott to announce his decision, he <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186113\">told the courtroom</a> that he had noticed some things about Hall‚Äôs testimony. After certain questions, Hall would ‚Äúmake direct eye contact‚Äù with Braxton before ‚Äútaking a moment or two to respond.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat tells me something, based on my years of experience,‚Äù Elliott said. But this did not excuse her. ‚ÄúWas she scared of him? Probably,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut, again, even weighing that factor into the equation I‚Äôm of the opinion she was less than candid.‚Äù He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1338621-tondalo-hall-documents.html#document/p32/a186114\">sentenced her</a> to 30 years in prison.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was speechless,‚Äù said Hall‚Äôs friend, Watts-Sparger, when she heard the news. ‚ÄúAll I could do was cry.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html\">appealed</a> her sentence to a three-judge panel and lost, though a dissenting judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355381-hall-appeal-ruling.html#document/p5/a186127\">declared</a> that she was a ‚Äúpoor, pathetic young woman with three young children who was involved in an abusive relationship.‚Äù She filed another petition that asked Elliott, the trial judge, to modify her sentence<b>.</b> He <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355382-hall-sentence-modification-request-denial.html\">denied it</a>, because too much time had elapsed so he no longer had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Elliott told BuzzFeed News that he didn‚Äôt have any recollection of the details of the case ‚Äî it was too long ago for him to remember. Still, he said, ‚ÄúI feel very comfortable with my decision, because I take every decision seriously.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Smith, Hall‚Äôs attorney, also said he couldn‚Äôt remember the specifics of the case. Marsee, the prosecutor, told BuzzFeed News that she, like Hall, felt that Braxton‚Äôs prison term was far too short. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to tell you how frustrated I was with that whole situation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unfortunate.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But the fact that she was scared does not absolve her of her duty as a mother. ‚ÄúHer sentence is appropriate for what she allowed him to do to her children,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey lived in pain because of what she did not stop.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231518\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"470\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 422px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231518','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/12/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-22724-1415728020-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Now Hall awaits the result of her commutation request.</p>\n<p>The author of the law under which Hall was convicted serves as the interim executive director of the parole board. Jari Askins was an Oklahoma state representative in 2000 when she wrote a bill that created the crime of ‚Äúenabling child abuse,‚Äù with the word ‚Äúenabling‚Äù meant to drive home that a failure to act was enough to warrant prosecution.</p>\n<p>Her law makes Oklahoma one of at least 29 states that explicitly criminalize parents‚Äô failure to protect their children from abuse. Prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws, such as ones against placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>Askins, whose long career in public service includes stints as a judge and lieutenant governor, told BuzzFeed News that she is sensitive to the plight of battered women. When her law was being considered, she said, she and her fellow legislators didn‚Äôt contemplate that it might help imprison women who themselves had been victimized by their partners. As executive director, she does not vote on clemency requests. Speaking generally, not of Hall‚Äôs case, she said that being battered is a mitigating circumstance that defendants could raise at trial.</p>\n<p>In her application for clemency, Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186434\">wrote</a> that the opposite happened. ‚ÄúI believe that my testimony detailing the violence in our home was used against me,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúRather than being protected by the State, I was prosecuted.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hall <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p10/a186435\">expressed remorse</a> for not getting her children out of the home sooner: ‚ÄúI had a duty to protect my children and I failed.‚Äù But, she <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p12/a186156\">wrote</a>, ‚ÄúI was trapped in an abusive relationship and I feared that alerting authorities would provoke Robert to increase his violence.‚Äù She <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1355282-tondalo-hall-commutation-application.html#document/p11/a186121\">said</a> she also feared that Braxton would gain custody of her children. ‚ÄúMy decisions, although detrimental to my family, were made out of fear rather than rationality.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Since she got to prison, Hall has completed her GED and taken parenting classes. She holds down a job in the laundry department. And she writes letters to her children, the youngest of whom is now 10. They write her back maybe once a month or so, she said, telling her how they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre up to.</p>\n<p>The letters update Hall on how grades are going, when spring break is approaching, what the word perimeter means. The children talk about riding bikes and what presents Santa might bring. Some feature drawings. One has two stick figures, with the person on the left labeled ‚Äúme‚Äù and the person on the right labeled ‚Äúyou.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One letter tells Hall that about some new shoes and a favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. It also asks her a question:</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhy did my Father break my leg, and ribs? I love you.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3508677_4231654\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"677\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 629px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3508677_4231654','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/11/13/enhanced/webdr12/longform-original-31912-1415731246-24.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Tondalo Hall</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Email the reporter at alex.campbell@buzzfeed.com</i></p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n</div>\n\n        \n        \n\n    \n    <p class=\"print c\"><a href=\"http://buzzfeed.com\"><b>Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!</b></a></p>\n\n\n\n    \n\t\n\t</div>"], ["created_at", "2014-11-17 13:55:52.628528"], ["link_identifier", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/this-battered-woman-wants-to-get-out-of-prison"], ["main_img_url", "http://s3-ak.buzzfeed.com/static/2014-11/11/15/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-7653-1415738459-12.jpg"], ["pub_date", "2014-11-12"], ["title", "This Battered Woman Wants To Get Out Of¬†Prison"], ["updated_at", "2014-11-17 13:55:52.628528"]]

I didn‚Äôt mean to scare you!‚Äù</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs the first thing Connie Britton said on national television, way back in 1996. It was a fitting introduction to her character, Nikki Faber, on the long-running ABC show <i>Spin City</i>, in which she played the sometimes raunchy, oversexed love interest to Michael J. Fox as they attempted to manage the publicity of the bumbling New York City mayor.</p>\n<p>The character on <i>Spin City</i> has Britton‚Äôs face, but the rest is nearly unrecognizable: Her hair is shorter, browner, and cut in the choppy layers that anyone familiar with the ‚Äò90s will recognize as ‚ÄúThe Rachel.‚Äù Nikki is a classic man-eater: She alludes to threesomes, she towers her co-stars, she‚Äôs coarse and vulgar when the rest of the women in the office come off as sweet or clueless. It‚Äôs a choice role (especially for a relative newcomer), but it‚Äôs also completely at odds with the way we think of Connie Britton today.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_right_large image_lfrl no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4213306\" rel:buzz_num=\"22\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"293\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 245px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:22\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4213306','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/9/enhanced/webdr12/longform-4138-1415544342-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Dreamworks SKG / Courtesy Everett Collection</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Because Nikki Faber is no Tami Taylor. Tami Taylor ‚Äî she of the ‚Äúy‚Äôall‚Äù and the hair and the aviators, of the soft exterior and steely drive, of infinite wisdom and ageless beauty. No matter that <i>Friday Night Lights</i> was one of the lowest rated and most beleaguered network shows in recent memory: Through the magic cultural catch-up tool that is Netflix, Taylor has taken on the sort of iconic importance usually reserved for massive Hollywood stars‚Äô roles. If <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and its brand of thoughtful, empathetic, addictive drama has morphed into a quasi-religion, then Tami Taylor is its patron saint, the complicated embodiment of all that made the show feel different and real and smart.</p>\n<p>The character of Tami Taylor lived for 76 episodes and five seasons ‚Äî long enough for her character to subsume the actress who played her. Even in her subsequent starring roles in <i>American Horror Story</i> and <i>Nashville</i> feel like she‚Äôs just following a different path on the Tami Taylor Choose Your Adventure novel: In one, her marriage falls apart and she ends up having sex with a man in a rubber suit; in another, she becomes a famous country singer with a complicated love life. But the center ‚Äî the Tami Taylor-ified charisma, the waterfall of hair, and the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about you, do we need to have a talk‚Äù face ‚Äî remains.</p>\n<p>The fortitude and consistency of that center has fostered an adult cult of Connie Britton: a mass of women, mostly between the ages of 20 and 45, who view Britton not just with affection, or awe, but admiration. Every star has fans, but select few have cults. We often associate the word ‚Äúcult‚Äù with mindless, manipulated masses, but the word also connotes a group whose beliefs are in some way deviant or different. If Britton had become a star during those <i>Spin City</i> years, there‚Äôd be nothing cultish about loving her: Like so many other sitcom stars, she was somewhere around 30, thin, white, beautiful, straight.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212612\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:description=\"Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:17\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212612\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212612\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:17\" rel:count=\"2\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>But loving the Britton of today is tantamount to ignoring much of what Hollywood has tried to impute as ideal. She‚Äôs still thin, white, beautiful, and straight, but she‚Äôs the thing that the vast majority of mainstream media pretends doesn‚Äôt exist: a woman over 40. More specifically, a woman over 40 whose image combines the sexual <i>and</i> the maternal, the ambitious <i>and</i> the empathetic. As one fan of the hundreds who, when solicited, offered testimonials about why they loved Britton told me, ‚ÄúShe makes getting older seem incredibly appealing ‚Äî not just because she looks stunning, but it‚Äôs the sense of presence and surety she projects.‚Äù The combination of confidence and beauty, of wisdom and maturity ‚Äî that‚Äôs what undergirds her fandom.</p>\n<p>At this moment, the seeming singularity of Connie Britton, and the magnitude of the affection directed toward her, bespeaks a generalized hunger for a female star that models a nuanced, mature, and periodically imperfect form of femininity. It‚Äôs about the hair, of course ‚Äî which has taken on a near totemic function ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also about much more than that.</p>\n<p>Britton is by no means the biggest star in Hollywood: <i>Nashville</i> is limping through its third season, and she was on screen for all of 10 minutes in her most recent film, <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>. But if you look closely, she might be one of the most important. Hollywood didn‚Äôt make Connie Britton a star, cobbling together the most reductive and regressive notions of what it means to be a woman today. We did, forging her in the most hopeful and realistic yet strong versions of our best selves.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212500\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212500','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-25731-1415572485-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Tommaso Boddi / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The narrative of Britton‚Äôs early career has been recited in the various profiles of her post-<i>Friday Night Lights</i> fame. She grew up fairly WASP-y in Maryland and Virginia, went to Dartmouth, majored in Asian Studies, studied abroad with (now Sen.) Kirsten Gillibrand. She‚Äôd been involved in theater in high school and, after graduating from college, moved to New York and married her college boyfriend, and while he became a finance banker, she dabbled in off-off-Broadway productions while taking part-time jobs to help pay the bills, including one as an aerobics instructor, leg warmers and all. (Britton declined to be interviewed for this story.)</p>\n<p>Britton and the finance husband divorced in 1995, but at that point she had spent eight months shooting the film that would put her, however briefly, on the map as the frustrated wife of an adulterous man in Ed Burns‚Äô debut feature, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i>, a small character study with a tiny budget that went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.</p>\n<p><i>McMullen</i> didn‚Äôt make Britton a household name, but it did put her on casting directors‚Äô radar, which is how she nearly won the <i>Jerry Maguire</i> role that eventually went to Renee Zellweger.</p>\n<p>Two paths diverged in a Hollywood casting room: One star (Zellweger) became a household name, while the other went on to a string of sitcoms. The <i>Maguire</i> role would have made Britton into a late-‚Äò90s It Girl, but one look at the current state of Zellweger‚Äôs career ‚Äî and the current uproar over daring to age and/or her resistance to it ‚Äî and you can see why Britton should be thankful to have missed the chance to make out with Tom Cruise.</p>\n<p>Instead of <i>Maguire</i>, Britton found herself cast in a slew of doomed pilots and in a multi-episode stint on the original <i>Ellen</i> as the overbearing, clueless sister of one of Ellen‚Äôs best friends, and eventually landed the role of Nikki on <i>Spin City</i>, where she would win the sort of quiet following that often follows supporting sitcom characters.</p>\n<p>But when Fox‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs disease forced him to leave <i>Spin City</i> in 2000, Britton‚Äôs character was written off the show. For the next six years, she jumped from one small role to the next, sometimes picking up a recurring gig, as she did in <i>The West Wing</i>, other times ending up a piece of ‚Äò80s-costumed window dressing, as she did in the film adaptation of Buzz Bissinger‚Äôs <i>Friday Night Lights</i> in 2004. It was an exhausting, frustrating schlep between sets and roles and disappointments.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Peter Berg, who had produced the film version of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, was working on a television adaptation for NBC that would be far more loosely based on the real-life events collected in Bissinger‚Äôs book. He asked Britton to reprise the same role she had played in the film, promising that this time, her role would be more fleshed out. ‚ÄúI was really, really hesitant,‚Äù Britton told <i>Variety.</i> ‚ÄúIn fact, I said, ‚ÄòNo. I love you and adore you, but I don‚Äôt want to.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yet Berg reiterated his promise for something bigger and meatier than a meekly supportive coach‚Äôs wife ‚Äî and it was that role, as guidance counselor, mother, wife, and eventually principal, that would, over the course of five seasons, turn Connie Britton into the household name that she nearly became more than a decade before. She wasn‚Äôt a buxom young starlet or the hottest new thing; she was just, quite simply and clearly, one of television‚Äôs best actresses in one of its most complicated roles.</p>\n<p>The details of Britton‚Äôs struggle ultimately matter less than the sheer fact of a woman breaking through in Hollywood at the age of 39. But that‚Äôs just one of the qualities of Britton‚Äôs image that have made it so pervasively popular over the last eight years. For men and women alike, she exudes what feels like an amorphous, complex feminine aura. But ask any woman to tease that apart and you‚Äôll see it‚Äôs an amalgamation of several interlocking areas: softness, maturity, progressiveness, and a particular take on ‚Äúhaving it all.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212371\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 852px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212371','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/0/enhanced/webdr07/longform-original-306-1415509225-16.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Michael Loccisano / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù isn‚Äôt to do with Britton‚Äôs body ‚Äî which is pilates-toned, but by no means a size zero ‚Äî so much as her demeanor. And the way we understand Britton‚Äôs demeanor is as an extension of Tami Taylor, who spent five seasons negotiating her way to power from the stereotypically subservient position of ‚Äúcoach‚Äôs wife‚Äù in a football-obsessed town.</p>\n<p>Instead of forcefully critiquing the cultural infrastructure from the outside, she works within its existing boundaries to change it. Her beauty, her smile, that nice-lady voice, all of it is a way of getting what she/the high school students she counsels want or need, especially when dealing with apparatuses of power (the boosters, the school board, Joe McCoy). She kills not with kindness, but with <a href=\"http://https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vihYkEAQ_DY\">y‚Äôalls</a>.</p>\n<p>Tami‚Äôs power is negotiated, but it‚Äôs also a realistic rendering of how women in much of America are able to fight and win battles on a daily basis. Instead of busting balls, attempting to engage in conversation. Instead of insulting another‚Äôs way of life, trying to inhabit it. Tami‚Äôs mix of the soft Southern exterior with steely drive emulates a form of activism wholly recognizable to anyone who‚Äôs attempted to effect change in an environment wholly resistant to it.</p>\n<p>That Tami Taylor brand of softness is replicated in Britton‚Äôs off-screen persona. No matter that Britton isn‚Äôt exactly a native Southerner: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/conniebritton\">Her Twitter account</a> is littered with y‚Äôalls. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that Britton is performing ‚Äúsoftness‚Äù; rather, it‚Äôs become a naturally accentuated component of her public persona. It‚Äôs amplified every time an interviewer asks her to recreate the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of Tami Taylor ‚Äî getting her to don Taylor‚Äôs signature aviators, for example ‚Äî and underlined in her leading role in <i>Nashville</i>, in which she might say fewer ‚Äúy‚Äôalls‚Äù but still embraces the same model of conciliatory power and strength, this time with more glitter and halter tops. The softness ‚Äî and its power to persuade ‚Äî endures. And of course, on screen and off, with its soft waves, its welcoming caramel color, there‚Äôs the hair.</p>\n<p>When people talk about Britton, the first thing they talk about is the hair. Even in professional interviews, journalists ask her about it. Seth Meyers pegged <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj7nBKUXg8\">an entire segment</a> to it. The Britton cover story in <i>More</i> magazine begins with, ‚ÄúThe hair is tawny, thick, and tousled to casual perfection. And it‚Äôs all her own.‚Äù <i>American Horror Story</i> showrunner Ryan Murphy says, ‚ÄúShe has the best hair in Hollywood.‚Äù And then there‚Äôs the hair-supported <a href=\"about:blank\">Tumblr</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ConBritsHair\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.birchbox.com/magazine/video/how-to-connie-britton-waves\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.today.com/style/connie-britton-hair-how-to-tutorial-hairstyle-I535890\">endless</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tvt3QU7Z-8k\">tutorials</a>.</p>\n<p>The hair connotes softness, but it also suggests a sort of unfettered, unabashed womanliness. It‚Äôs not just the volume ‚Äî although that‚Äôs part of it ‚Äî or the beautiful color. It‚Äôs not even the hair itself so much as what it‚Äôs not: namely, the stereotypical haircut of a fortysomething mother, doomed to the next four decades of practical mom-cuts.</p>\n<p>As cultural critics Sarah Blackwood and Sarah Mesle <a href=\"http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2012/10/16/on-connie-brittons-hair/\">put it</a>, ‚ÄúThe Hair asks us to think about a heavy ponytail at 40. Let‚Äôs not dismiss this as a joke, or as the same question as Botox or artificially plumped lips. If Botox is always about youth obsession, Connie Britton‚Äôs Hair is not always ‚Äî or even ever ‚Äî an attempt to look like Lyla Garrity or Hayden Panettiere. It might actually be about the specific pleasure of forty-ness.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The utter fullness of the hair is like a testament to a life well-lived. The strawberry blonde highlights suggest a life spent in the sun; its ability to swing in a ponytail, to rope up in a French twist, tousle around the shoulders, even to look just this side of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jbf%20hair\">J.B.F</a>., is like an extension of all the modes of femininity occupied by today‚Äôs accomplished woman.</p>\n<p>Britton‚Äôs hair refuses to hew the line of what a woman‚Äôs hair (or life) should resemble. It‚Äôs not unruly the way that, say, Helena Bonham Carter‚Äôs hair is ‚Äî but it declares, through its sheer existence, a different self-conception for a woman over 40 than those proffered by the media. The hair, in other words, feels like a revelation.</p>\n<p>But if we‚Äôre talking about Connie Britton‚Äôs hair, we‚Äôre also talking about the way it complements her face. Usually people say that a face ‚Äúbetrays‚Äù one‚Äôs age, but Britton‚Äôs face functions as the opposite of betrayal: Each smile line and crow‚Äôs-foot makes her somehow more, not <i>less</i>, beautiful. She‚Äôs not old; she‚Äôs <i>mature</i>. And with that maturity comes a certain wisdom: the ability, for example, to discuss big, often alienating issues with grace and empathy, whether it‚Äôs talking to her teenage daughter about losing her virginity (<i>Friday Night Lights</i>) or figuring out how to admit that her marriage is over (<i>Nashville</i>).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item longform_pullquote  buzz_superlist_item_left_small   \" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212609\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\n<div class=\"share-box bf_dom\">\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-facebook-share fa-facebook fa\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"facebook3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"fb-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:description=\"Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-twitter-share fa fa-twitter\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"twitter3505101_4212609\" rel:via=\"annehelen\" rel:sub_title=\"Usually%20male%20stars%20are%20the%20ones%20who%20grow%20into%20their%20looks%20‚Äî\" rel:adtl_tweet_text=\" \" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"tw-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/list-item:16\"></a>\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t<a class=\"share-icon bf_dom sub-buzz-response-share response-button\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"response3505101_4212609\" rel:bf_bucket_data='{\"response-share\":{\"id\":\"3505101_4212609\"}}' rel:gt_act=\"share/contribute/list-item:16\" rel:count=\"5\"></a>\n\t\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n\t<blockquote class=\"white_pullquote\" style=\"font-family: 'Quicksand'; font-weight: regular; line-height: 1.1em; font-size: 36px; color: #000000; background-color: #FFFFFF; \">Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant.</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs no coincidence that Britton worked in Hollywood for decades before breaking through. She was always beautiful, but it wasn‚Äôt until she looked the way she does now that beauty became one of her defining adjectives. Usually male stars are the ones who grow into their looks ‚Äî see George Clooney, Jon Hamm, even Cary Grant ‚Äî but most female stars peak and often became hyperreal versions of their former selves, an amalgam of precise surgery and injections.</p>\n<p>In this way, Britton‚Äôs refusal to transform her face becomes an act of rebellion against a system of norms that would rather she freeze all movement above her eyebrows than have a visible wrinkle. But Britton has also consciously refused to bend her narrative into that of a woman obsessed with her own aging. As she told <i>Esquire</i>, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt really focused on myself as a quote-unquote ‚Äòwoman maturing.‚Äô I try to avoid that at all costs. ‚Ä¶ Some of the press that happened around <i>Nashville</i> really was an eye-opener for me, because there were a lot of initial stories describing my character as ‚Äòaging‚Äô and ‚Äòover the hill,‚Äô and I was like, ‚ÄòWhat the fuck?‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n<p>Originally, Britton‚Äôs <i>Nashville</i> character was framed as the aging has-been to Hayden Panettiere‚Äôs Taylor Swift-esque ingenue, but Britton hated the dichotomy. She fought the writers to cut scenes, like one planned for the premiere, in which she did the stereotypical pull-at-your-face-and-look-sad routine. She was ‚Äúfurious‚Äù about the trajectory of her character, especially, as Britton explained, given what had recently happened in her own career: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even who I represent as an actor,‚Äù she <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all\">told</a> the <i>New York Times.</i> ‚ÄúMy life started being awesome five years ago.‚Äù</p>\n<p>To admit that life can, indeed, start to be awesome at 40 ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great quote. But it also exemplifies the sort of ideological rebellion that crystallizes the cult around her.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212435\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212435','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr06/longform-original-25154-1415572512-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Jonathan Leibson / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, we never know how Eric and Tami Taylor vote. We can safely assume that the rest of their small Texas town almost certainly votes Republican, but the narrative never hinges on questions of political affinity. Rather, it divides on lines of haves and have-nots, of who advocates for which side and with what motivation. Tami Taylor might not label herself a liberal, but she‚Äôs an unequivocal progressive, working on the micro scale to rectify macro-level divisions of class, race, and gender.</p>\n<p>The most prominent example manifests in the form of Taylor‚Äôs counsel to Becky, a 16-year-old who becomes pregnant the first time she has sex. When Becky asks Tami how she‚Äôd advise her own daughter in the same situation, Tami‚Äôs response is a master class in ethical counsel: ‚ÄúI would tell her to think about her life, think about what‚Äôs important to her and what she wants, and I would tell her that she‚Äôs in a real tough spot, and then I would support whatever decision she made.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The episode received a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/10/arts/television/10lights.html\">significant</a> <a href=\"http://feministing.com/2010/07/12/friday-night-lights-takes-on-abortion/\">amount</a> <a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2010/02/04/friday-night-lights-abortion-plotline-mustsee-tv/\">of</a> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/07/friday-night-lights-tackles-abortion/59495/\">attention</a>, in part because it was the first to directly address abortion on broadcast television since, well, <i>Maude,</i> nearly three decades before. But it‚Äôs but one of dozens of ways in which Taylor‚Äôs character models a progressive social view: the way she advocates for, and achieves, an equal partnership with her husband; her handling of the revelation of the mayor‚Äôs lesbianism; the best sex talk in television history; her overarching and persistent advocacy for Tyra in all parts of her life. You could say that Tami‚Äôs just doing her job as a guidance counselor, but she‚Äôs doing her job in a deeply humanistic way that‚Äôs implicitly, if not explicitly, in line with the aims of social justice.</p>\n<p>Tami is outspoken and candid, never didactic or preachy. It‚Äôs the way, really, so many of us imagine our best activist selves: not as actors in some hyperpoliticized arena, but as good people helping and doing and advising not because of some overarching ideology, but because it seems right.</p>\n<p>If Tami Taylor is the primary narrative agent of social justice in <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, then it makes sense that the aura of progressivism clings to Britton‚Äôs image outside of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>. But Britton‚Äôs own actions have only strengthened the conflation of Taylor‚Äôs work with her ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù beliefs. When the Mitt Romney campaign started using the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> catchphrase ‚ÄúClear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can‚Äôt Lose,‚Äù Britton shot back, penning an <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/28/women-birth-control-friday-night-lights/1663895/\">editorial</a> for <i>USA Today</i> arguing that Romney‚Äôs stance on birth control was counter to the central tenets of <i>Friday Night Lights.</i> During Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis‚Äô filibuster to block a restrictive antiabortion bill, Britton not only proclaimed her support, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/connie-britton-lisa-edelstein-support-578118\">but released a limited-edition T-shirt</a> inscribed with ‚ÄúWhat Would Tami Taylor Do?‚Äù (<a href=\"http://standwithtexaswomen.org\">standwithtexaswomen.org</a> on the back) with all proceeds directed to Planned Parenthood.</p>\n<p>Britton, like Taylor ‚Äî and like the stated doctrine of Planned Parenthood ‚Äî is not advocating for abortion, but for <i>choice</i>. But even that sort of advocacy would be too much of a polarizing issue for most celebrities to touch. It‚Äôs OK to support a political candidate, but a divisive issue like abortion, that‚Äôs something else entirely.</p>\n<p>But if Britton‚Äôs willingness to attach herself to the issue of reproductive rights might have alienated a minority of fans, it served to fortify the support of the majority and solidify the cult. Even as it‚Äôs become increasingly accepted for celebrities to identify as feminists, few speak specifically about what that means, in action ‚Äî in part, of course, to avoid losing fans or potential projects. Britton‚Äôs vocal support of feminist candidates and causes makes her advocacy seem less strategic, performative, or planned and more of an extension of a ‚Äútrue‚Äù self and belief system.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212608\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1013\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 965px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3505101_4212608','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/17/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19629-1415572543-25.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Rick Diamond / Getty</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a woman to ‚Äúhave it all,‚Äù she must, in some vague, unspecific terms, manage to simultaneously satisfy her boss, her children, and her partner; then, and only then, can she can be satisfied herself. And beautiful, and adhering to generalized body norms, and emotionally and spiritually fulfilled. As many have argued, ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù is just the ideal set forth by a postfeminist ideology in which all women should be all things to all people, with little mind to how it negates and evacuates the self.</p>\n<p>Britton‚Äôs image, with its resounding echoes of Tami Taylor, offers a different take on the ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù scenario. As one half of what has been called ‚Äú<a href=\"http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/04/11/greatest-tv-couple-staff-pick-friday-night-lights/\">the greatest TV couple of all time</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/02/friday-night-lights-finale-how-the-best-marriage-on-tv-was-created/70996/\">the best marriage on television</a>,‚Äù Britton ‚Äî along with co-star Kyle Chandler ‚Äî models a relationship that‚Äôs an actual partnership. It‚Äôs imperfect, it‚Äôs filled with strife, but unlike most television dramas, which pivot on the question of when and how a couple will end up cheating on each other, Britton and Chandler decided that potential infidelity would never be the guiding question of their on-screen relationship.</p>\n<p>Rather, the narrative focuses on how two ambitious, focused individuals do their best to keep loving each other ‚Äî and their daughters ‚Äî and still do the things that make them feel like worthwhile, accomplished humans. It‚Äôs never perfect: The house is never clean, Baby Gracie is often lugged around in confusion, teenage Julie is pissed a lot, and there is a modicum of white wine in every episode, but it feels like a lived-in, loving partnership, something to which a couple can aspire, rather than a way of judging their deficiencies. And the message of the series finale ‚Äî in which Tami tells Eric that it‚Äôs her turn to let her career guide the trajectory of their lives ‚Äî is also the most radical way for a show about a football team to wrap up, ever, the end.</p>\n<p>The ‚Äúhaving it all‚Äù of <i>FNL</i> is having some of all the things that matter to you, and finding value and validation in doing the best you‚Äôre able at those chosen things. You see the same philosophy modeled in <i>Nashville</i>, in which Britton‚Äôs character manages to juggle a career, two daughters, a collapsing marriage, an alcoholic love-of-her-life, and multiple new suitors, while also serving as a mentor to younger artists and starting her own record label. Rayna James doesn‚Äôt do any of those things perfectly, but she does them ‚Äî and refuses to apologize for that seeming lack of perfection.</p>\n<p>At the heart of both characters is a complexity, and an eagerness to balance a multiplicity of identities, that Britton herself has pushed for. On <i>Friday Nights Lights,</i> her attention to her character‚Äôs trajectory was described as ‚Äúrabid‚Äù; for her turn in <i>This Is Where I Leave You</i>, she refused to allow the role of a woman dating a man two decades her junior to degenerate into that of a ‚Äúcougar.‚Äù When <i>Fast Company</i> <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3009149/most-creative-people-2013/13-connie-britton\">named</a> her as No. 13 of the ‚Äú100 Most Creative People In Business,‚Äù she outlined the strategy she‚Äôs adopted for ‚Äúowning‚Äù a character: With each script, she goes through the dialogue line by line, working with <i>Nashville</i> showrunner Callie Khouri to identify ‚Äúlines that don‚Äôt feel right‚Äù for the character of Rayna.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not difficult to understand, then, why so many ambitious women find themselves drawn to Britton and the women she‚Äôs played on screen: As one fan explained to me, ‚ÄúTami and Rayna totally captivate me because they‚Äôre each deeply OK with themselves, and that‚Äôs the source of their power.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That sort of deep ‚ÄúOK-ness‚Äù extends to Britton‚Äôs personal life, in which she‚Äôs balanced a career with the duties of single motherhood (she adopted a son, Yobi, from Ethiopia in 2011), advocacy, and even sex. Friend and producer Sarah Aubrey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/connie-britton-is-a-late-bloomer.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">told</a> the <i>New York</i> <i>Times</i> magazine that ‚Äúin my experience of watching Connie Britton‚Äôs dating life, it has not been Connie getting beaten out by 25-year-old girls, let‚Äôs leave it at that.‚Äù Or, in Britton‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs put it this way: The older you get, the easier it is to date younger men. There are more of them.‚Äù Britton‚Äôs been linked with comedian Jason Mantzoukas, but unlike contemporaries Jennifer Aniston or Cameron Diaz, whose love lives play out in the headlines, framed as fruitless searches for domestic bliss, Britton has kept her love life (and, presumably, really hot younger boyfriends) out of the limelight.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Britton acknowledges how difficult single parenthood is ‚Äî but also how privileged she is to have assistance. ‚ÄúOur hours [as actors] are long,‚Äù Britton <a href=\"http://www.redbookmag.com/fun-contests/celebrity/connie-britton-interview#slide-1\">told</a> <i>Redbook</i>, ‚Äúbut I would never compare what I do with what anyone else does. Everybody‚Äôs working hard and doing the best they can ‚Äî if you‚Äôre a mom, there‚Äôs that pressure, we all face it. I‚Äôm constantly being pulled in different directions. But that‚Äôs the thing: Moms are pulled and distracted. I would never say it‚Äôs worse for me because I‚Äôm an actor.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That frankness ‚Äî about the challenges of being a mother, but also the privileges and the desire and how to make it work with her life ‚Äî is what not only distinguishes Britton‚Äôs image, but makes it meaningful to so many women.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3505101_4212647\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"rubbable-container\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" width=\"625\" height=\"241\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/tmp/webdr12/anigif_mobile_cdc830fcd8c88ce0d5564b17ab78778a-19.gif\" rel:version=\"201411141357\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" alt=\"The Cult of Connie Britton\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-11/9/1/enhanced/webdr12/anigif_enhanced-mid-30924-1415515869-20.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Britton isn‚Äôt a movie star ‚Äî and it seems very unlikely she will become one. There‚Äôs a reason her most memorable roles are on television; why the most indelible vision of her isn‚Äôt on the front of a magazine, but in the <i>Friday Night Lights</i> opening credits, with her hair pulled haphazardly up, in a cotton T-shirt, raising her hands in the air in a dance-like victory. She could be your own mom, or sister, or best friend, proclaiming some small life victory in your own little kitchen after a glass of wine at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>With a liberal arts education and a thoroughly middle-class upbringing, Britton‚Äôs image resonates most with women whose trajectories are similar: On and off <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, she may be advocating for those who don‚Äôt enjoy the same privilege as she does, but the cult of Britton does skew toward those who are educated, middle class, and white. Which isn‚Äôt to suggest that this is Britton‚Äôs ‚Äúfault‚Äù ‚Äî her race, class, and educational background were in place long before she became a star ‚Äî so much as to underline that Britton resonates with a particular demographic that, uncoincidentally, makes up a significant percentage of people who are sharing things on social media.</p>\n<p>This sort of highly specific popularity is the new normal: Instead of a common group of Hollywood stars and prominent public figures who function as de facto models for everyone, the fragmentation of the American entertainment industry has birthed more, not fewer, idols. The internet has facilitated the elevation of the weird, the unique, and those who speak specifically to groups of people who feel that no other mainstream idol could.</p>\n<p>Stardom scholar Richard Dyer <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Heavenly_Bodies.html?id=oUJ0Qbse7lYC\">claimed</a> that ‚Äústars matter because they act out aspects of life that matter to us; and performers get to be stars when what they act out matters to enough people.‚Äù Connie Britton can‚Äôt be a star, then, because what she acts out ‚Äî the possibility of beauty and vibrancy and sexuality over 40, unabashed advocacy and engaged feminist action ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt yet matter to enough people.</p>\n<p>The adult cult of Connie Britton is vocal and visible, but it‚Äôs still a fringe fandom. But the history of stardom is littered with actors whose importance didn‚Äôt become clear until years after their tenure, especially unruly, feminist ones like Katharine Hepburn, who was famously labeled ‚Äúbox office poison‚Äù in 1939, only to the next four decades slowly turning herself into an icon. But along with stars like Angelina Jolie, who has made it her mission <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/angelina-jolies-perfect-game\">to offer a different blueprint</a> for how to wield power and influence in Hollywood, Britton is fundamentally challenging the polished, safe, postfeminist vision of female stardom that currently dominates so much of the Hollywood landscape.

Here, in this quiet set of cinder block buildings amid the wilderness of Angeles National Forest, was a chance to be treated like a human being.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little bit ‚Äî not freedom, but you can move a little bit,‚Äù he told me a few weeks later.</p>\n<p>In order to remain and enjoy the perks of this summer camp‚Äìstyle prison, and in order to get the good-time credits that would allow him to serve only 35% of his seven-year sentence, he would need to stay in shape, remain on his best behavior, and summon all of his courage to do hard labor beside thousand-degree flames. He‚Äôd made it this far, through months of training behind Pitchess Detention Center, the guards checking his ass for stolen tools every night as he came back into the dorms. When he got to a real fire, when he felt its heat, would he find that he didn‚Äôt have what it took?</p>\n<p>About half of the people fighting wildland fires on the ground for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are incarcerated: over 4,400 prisoners, housed at 42 inmate fire camps, including three for women. Together, says Capt. Jorge Santana, the California Department of Corrections &amp; Rehabilitation (CDCR) liaison who supervises the camps, they save the state over $1 billion a year. This year, California has had <a href=\"http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/incidents/incidents_stats?year=2014\">over 5,300 wildfires,</a> which is about 700 more than had occurred by this time in 2013, and a thousand more than the five-year average. Now, as the West is coming to the end of one of the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/10/22/358096112/coping-in-a-drier-world-californias-drought-survival-strategy\">driest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-warmest-year-california-heat-20140917-story.html\">hottest</a> years in recorded history, the work of inmate firefighters has become essential to California‚Äôs financial and environmental health.</p>\n<p>Someone called Barr‚Äôs name and directed him into a closet marked Evidence Room, where a guard handed him a black sign and took his photograph from behind a beige console housing an ancient PC. And then there he was on the screen: 6 feet 2 inches and sullen, with a big, soft face and an overgrown goatee.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your CDC number?‚Äù the guard asked him. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your date of birth? Where else have you done time? When are you going home?‚Äù</p>\n<p>As long as he didn‚Äôt mess this thing up, didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúrolled up,‚Äù as inmate firefighters call getting sent back to a walled institution, he‚Äôd be released in a little over a year, on Nov. 30, 2014. And he didn‚Äôt want to go back to drug dealing when he did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting close to 40. I don‚Äôt have another one in me,‚Äù he explained to me. It was his second conviction, and a third conviction for sales in California would put him away for life. ‚ÄúEvidently, it‚Äôs not working, so I have to try something else.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the fire camp, the questions continued: ‚ÄúWhile incarcerated have you ever been involved in a sexually related assault? Do you have any gang affiliation? Any other moniker besides your name? Any mental health concerns?‚Äù</p>\n<p>Barr gave the answers they wanted, and the man gave him his new identity on a small plastic card. He understood why they had to ask, even if almost no one told the truth. He knew this place was too dangerous for gangs. Turn against one another, lose trust in your crewmates, and you might not survive the next fire.</p>\n<p>Just as undeniable changes to the climate have made Cal Fire‚Äôs role even more crucial, its dirt-cheap supply of labor is being threatened, as the first trickles of a national movement toward prison reform arrive in California. Fire camps like Holton are supposed to accept only well-behaved inmates with no history of violence, arson, or sex crimes, and so most prisoner firefighters are, like Barr, serving time for low-level offenses, especially drug sales.</p>\n<p>With a <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2014/04/02/americas-new-drug-policy-landscape/\">majority</a> of Americans now questioning whether it is humane or economically sound to keep nonviolent drug offenders, who pose little or no threat to public safety, locked up for extended periods, the exact population of trustworthy inmates devoting their incarceration to wildfire protection has started finding its way back onto the streets much sooner. Because if we can trust guys like Barr on the front lines of a fire with a chainsaw or an axe, should they really be locked up for so long in the first place? At a time when a program like this has never been more necessary, its future has never been more in question.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143129\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143129','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr11/longform-original-20330-1414693569-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>There is nothing new about putting prisoners to work to cover the cost of their stay. As far back as the 12th century, during the reign of King Henry II, Britain‚Äôs private jail operators leased their prisoners out as daily workers to whoever could pay a rate higher than what it cost to give the inmates the food, water, and shelter necessary to survive.</p>\n<p>In the 18th century, most criminals in America were punished with fines, beatings, or death. It was the idealistic Quakers who thought incarceration and labor might be a more compassionate and useful alternative. Whether this held in practice is debatable: Although many in Philadelphia‚Äôs infamous Walnut Street Jail, which opened in the late 1700s, spent their days making handicrafts like wicker chairs to sell, every single prisoner lived in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p>Most of the county jails that began cropping up in the U.S. during the first half of the 19th century made no attempt at reforming or employing inmates. Then in 1867, early muckrakers E.C. Wines and Theodore W. Dwight published a scathing expos√© of American jails that called for prisons to become places that taught people how to become better citizens.</p>\n<p>Soon, all across the nation, those with an eye on rehabilitation and those with an eye on budgets found common ground in giving prisoners something useful and profitable to do. Leasing convicts to private businesses made a tidy fortune for both state and local governments, especially after slaves were emancipated. In 1878, 73% of Alabama‚Äôs entire state revenue came from prison labor. Reconstruction-era plantation owners, though, were hardly incentivized to care about their charges: When any of their starving workers died, they simply asked the state for new ones, at no cost to their bottom line.</p>\n<p>In the early 20th century, the tide of public opinion began to turn on prison labor. It wasn‚Äôt fair to allow such cheap workers in the market, the argument went, because it hurt competition and drove down wages for everybody. Since the late 1930s, prison labor in the United States has, for the most part, only been able to produce goods or provide services for the public sector.</p>\n<p>California‚Äôs fire camps began during World War II, when the state‚Äôs firefighters went off to fight and the inmates who had been tasked with building and maintaining public highways moved in to take their place. When the war ended, the state decided to keep them there. Nevada, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, and Utah all have since established fire camps of their own, but even the biggest of those programs is less than half the size of California‚Äôs. Now fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long American tradition of putting our criminals to work for hardly any money, under the auspices of rehabilitating them.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPrison labor has been most successful in areas where the risk of dying or being very seriously injured is pretty high,‚Äù said W. David Ball, an assistant professor in criminal justice at the Santa Clara University School of Law. After all, he says, convicted criminals have lost the right to manage their own lives, to a certain extent; when Congress passed the 13th Amendment in 1865, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude, they made sure to include the following phrase: ‚Äúexcept as a punishment for crime.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143140\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"997\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 949px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143140','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Fire camps remain one of the last vestiges of a long tradition of putting criminals to work for little money.\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-5042-1414693632-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúAtta baby!‚Äù Fire Captain Darus Ane shouted, extending his fist for a pound. ‚ÄúNice work, baby! Beautiful!‚Äù</p>\n<p>The approaching inmate wheezed back a ‚ÄúThanks, Cap!‚Äù before slowly lifting his hand from where it had been pushing down on his thigh with each step.</p>\n<p>A few yards downhill, Barr kept his eyes focused on the ground as he approached the ledge where Ane, a smiling Joe Biden look-alike with darker hair and a more genuine tan, was doling out words of encouragement.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaintain! Last 50 to the top!‚Äù Ane called to him. Barr huffed and puffed, shaking his head as he passed, refusing to make eye contact with either me or the captain.</p>\n<p>Barr had been at camp for six weeks, and he was exhausted. He hadn‚Äôt seen a fire yet, but every day he woke up and threw his body into whatever task Ane and the foremen set before him: gathering brush in the forest, clearing debris by the side of the road, pushing through a timed hike like this one.</p>\n<p>If he didn‚Äôt get to the top in time, he would get written up; dawdle up the mountain more than once, and he could get sent back to jail. He and his 15-man fire crew ‚Äî crew two ‚Äî were charging uphill in a steady stream, swerving around rocks and scrub. Some could barely breathe. Others leaped like it was nothing, sweat forming a dark V on the back of their orange jumpsuits.</p>\n<p>Once he settled into the camp routine, when the initial relief of being away from the nightmare of county jail wore off, the severity of this work became apparent. The only possible relief would come from getting more physically fit: ‚ÄúYou just have to train,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Ane has been leading inmate crews for two and a half years, enough time for him to hone a tough but upbeat disposition in the hopes that he can reform his charges. ‚ÄúWe gotta break them down physically to build them up mentally,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe show them that it takes hard work to be successful, and hard work usually pays off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The CDCR and state officials often frame the inmate firefighting program in a similar way, emphasizing the benefits of building discipline through physical labor and helping others.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDoing good things in life can change your whole world for you, because you will be remembered for that something good, instead of the negative,‚Äù former L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca <a href=\"http://www.dailynews.com/20121119/pitchess-detention-center-inmates-graduate-from-fire-training-camp\">told future fire camp inmates</a> at a county jail graduation ceremony in 2012.</p>\n<p>When Barr finally reached the summit, he was relieved to find that time had yet to run out. But just as he caught his breath it was time to pile back into the truck and head to another mountainside. There, crew two would throw on 40-pound packs, goggles, gloves, helmets, and boots, and spend three or four hours practicing what‚Äôs called ‚Äúcutting line,‚Äù the primary contribution that inmates make to the surge of overlapping efforts involved in fighting and containing a wildfire.</p>\n<p>When cutting line, the goal is to carve a path of exposed mineral soil in the earth that will stop the flames, blocking their access to more fuel. The work is difficult, hot, and monotonous. The most senior guys on the crew walk in front with chainsaws, and all they do is saw, saw, saw. Other inmates chop the chaparral with a Pulaski, a tool that is half axe, half adze. As one of the newest guys on the crew, Barr was third from the back with a combination rake and hoe, called a McLeod, bending to scrape the dirt and push grasses out of the way until his back was sore and his body drenched in sweat.</p>\n<p>Paid firefighters cut line too, sometimes, but mostly they drive the bulldozers, they grip the hoses, they scribble strategy on clipboards, and they dump water and bright red retardant from air tankers and helicopters. Pretty much all inmates will do on a fire is head into steep terrain, where bulldozers can‚Äôt reach, and cut line.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTheir value is that force of human power,‚Äù said Janet Upton, the deputy director of communications at Cal Fire.</p>\n<p>As he toiled in the sun for less $2 a day, Barr couldn‚Äôt help but point out what he saw as fire camp‚Äôs unacknowledged historical precedent: slavery. (Prisoner firefighters in California earn that base salary and an additional $1 an hour when they are on a fire.) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not <i>right</i>,‚Äù he told me.</p>\n<p>Barr‚Äôs not the only inmate to make that comparison. A few years ago, when University of Toronto sociologist Philip Goodman was working on his dissertation at University of California ‚Äì Irvine, he spoke to more than 45 prisoner firefighters. Ten used the word ‚Äúslavery‚Äù to describe their experiences, but seven of those ten also used the word ‚Äúrehabilitation.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Later that afternoon, back at camp, Barr was free to move about as he pleased: to play Ping-Pong or pinochle, to lift weights, to build a wooden clock with the circle saws in the hobby shop, to catch a movie on one of two big-screen TVs. He could take out as many books as he wanted from the library, rather than just one a week. He could joke around with guys of other races without fear of fights.</p>\n<p>One of the inmate chefs was outside plucking corn, peppers, and tomatoes from the camp garden to put in the salsa for that evening‚Äôs taco night. Two black Labradors roamed the camp off-leash, creating an oddly domestic feeling, even if they were there to sniff for drugs.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than where I was at. I‚Äôll just leave it at that,‚Äù Barr said. ‚ÄúHere, at least, you can come outside.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He mostly hoped to make it through the next 11 months as quickly as possible. He also grew impatient with any talk of how this program could somehow fundamentally change him, as a person, for the better.</p>\n<p>Inmates are often insulted by the state‚Äôs claims to be teaching them how to work. Most come from poverty, where holding down two minimum wage jobs and putting in 70-hour weeks will get you nowhere fast. Many, as people of color, face profound socially and politically condoned opposition in ascending the socioeconomic ladder, regardless of how hard they work.</p>\n<p>Barr only has a high school education, and says selling crack seemed like the most lucrative option available to him. He regrets dropping out of junior college after less than a semester, and he snorts with laughter when he hears that part of the justification for sending him to fight fires is that he must learn how to work hard in order to abandon his criminal ways.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course I knew how to work hard before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was just working hard at something illegal.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143152\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1064\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1016px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143152','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"Of course I knew how to work hard before, I was just working hard at something illegal.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1338-1414693695-4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Amanda Chicago Lewis for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Barr shifted in his seat as the Los Angeles County fire truck rumbled along the empty streets of Glendora. The day before, on Jan. 16, three guys in their early twenties had decided to go camping on federal land in Angeles National Forest. ‚ÄúGoing to hunt mountain lions,‚Äù one posted on Facebook, before tagging his two friends. In the morning, the powerful Santa Ana winds blew a piece of paper from their illegal campfire into the brush, igniting the entire hillside. By the time Barr‚Äôs crew rolled in, over 3,600 residents had been evacuated and five homes destroyed due to what was being called the Colby Fire. The blaze had already consumed 1,700 acres since morning.</p>\n<p>Barr had been at fire camp for less than three months. The truck stopped, and the crew began to file off. ‚ÄúThis was the test,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>January is not typically part of what‚Äôs called fire season, when conditions in the western United States are most likely to turn a flicked cigarette butt into a dangerous, expensive nightmare. The Colby Fire was one of over a thousand that came well before the end of spring in 2014, signaling this year would likely bring an unprecedented number of incidents, straining resources across the region.</p>\n<p>But the current drought ‚Äî deemed ‚Äú<a href=\"http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Home/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?CA\">exceptional</a>‚Äù in July by the federal government ‚Äî is not an anomaly, a problem that will go away next year. It‚Äôs more like a warning shot, signaling a permanent shift in the moisture level of the soil, the brush and the timber. Although most firefighting personnel will hem and haw about why, exactly, the climate is changing, afraid to take what‚Äôs seen as a political stance on global warming, they all acknowledge that conditions are getting progressively worse. That means that in the coming years, Cal Fire will need to hire more firefighters and find money to pay for more frequent and intense blazes. Already, the coffers are in trouble.</p>\n<p>When Barr got to the Colby Fire, as soon as he started to work, adrenaline flooded his senses, bringing his attention to the task at hand. ‚ÄúThat anxiety went away. It was just something regular. It kicked in, my training.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For 12 hours, from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m., he swept the ground with his McLeod, over and over, until the brown dirt turned to silt. They walked and walked, until they were inches from the flames. And a few times, as they strode at a rapid pace across inclines so precipitous they approached the vertical, he slipped and fell, but he always stood back up again, following the foreman, doing whatever was asked of him.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe foremen I have, they know what they‚Äôre doing. I know they wouldn‚Äôt put me in a dangerous situation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSometimes they have their days, probably had a bad day with the wife and kids, but other than that they treat us like, you know, like we‚Äôre one of them, basically, pretty much.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Finally, with the first glows of twilight, they headed back to Holton to get some rest before the next shift. When he got to camp, at dawn, Barr heard that some of the guys on another crew had screamed when they first got to the fire.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúLike little girls,‚Äù he told me later. ‚ÄúNot crew two! We know what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the afternoon of Jan. 17, when Barr returned to the fire for his second day, he could hardly feel the cuts and bruises from where he‚Äôd fallen the night before. Driving in, he saw the residents applauding them as they passed.</p>\n<p>His crew worked the fire for a week, and by the end he had developed a new respect for the firemen who took custody of him during the day, for their expertise and for the seriousness of their mission.</p>\n<p>Usually, inmate firefighters lack the cocksure gait that characterizes paid firefighters.

But in this era of deficit reduction and belt-tightening that began with the Great Recession, the <a href=\"http://famm.org/the-facts-with-sources/#7\">public</a> has largely finally grown weary of the expensive fact that United States has 5% of the world‚Äôs population but 25% of the world‚Äôs prisoners. Attorney General Eric Holder <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/holder-mandatory-minimums/\">announced</a> last August that the federal government would no longer pursue such long sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, inspired by reform in states like Texas, Rhode Island, and New York.</p>\n<p>California‚Äôs drug-offender sentencing policy remains among the strictest in the country. As a result, California‚Äôs prisons have <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/07/convicting-california\">long suffered</a> the natural consequences of overcrowding, including delayed medical treatment and inhumane conditions. In 2011, after a protracted legal battle, the Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24scotus.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">ordered</a> California to dramatically reduce the population of its prisons.</p>\n<p>To do so, instead of seeking significant sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders, Gov. Jerry Brown decided to shift responsibility for most low-level criminals from state prison to county jail, where conditions were not regulated under the court order.</p>\n<p>In some counties, this process ‚Äî euphemistically called ‚Äúrealignment‚Äù ‚Äî didn‚Äôt prove to be much of a problem, because they had space in their jails to spare, or made space to spare, but a <a href=\"http://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/child-page/183091/doc/slspublic/Petersilia%20VOICES%20no%20es%20Final%20022814.pdf\">third</a> of California‚Äôs state prison population comes from Los Angeles. Within two years, an additional 8,000 inmates, including Barr, were serving time in L.A. County jails.</p>\n<p>Fire camps had always been for state prisoners, not county inmates, because Cal Fire and the CDCR consider it a waste of money to train firefighters who have less than a year of time to serve. So with most low-level offenders no longer being housed at state prison, fire camps must negotiate separate contracts with individual counties, as they did with Los Angeles, in order to keep their barracks full. Barr is one of 528 L.A. County inmates who <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/17/local/la-me-0918-jail-problems-20130918\">began</a> filling five local fire camps at the end of last year. To inspire similar deals elsewhere, Brown‚Äôs 2014‚Äì2015 budget included major financial incentives for counties to send their low-level offenders to fire camp. And to encourage inmates like Barr to sign up, county inmates who go to fire camp serve only 35% of their sentences, even as their counterparts from state prison serve 50% or even 80%.</p>\n<p>But in the next few years, California <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-proposition47-20141012-story.html\">may see more</a> serious sentencing reform, which would help bring nonviolent drug offenders back to their families faster but would significantly damage the state‚Äôs firefighting capabilities at a time when every penny counts.</p>\n<p>Already, in 2012, voters passed a law that eliminated life sentences for most third-strike nonviolent offenders; next week, voters will likely pass a ballot measure called Proposition 47 that would go even further, downgrading drug possession and minor property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. And at the end of September, Brown signed a bill that will reduce sentences for crack sales to the same level as cocaine sales, starting in 2015. Lynne Lyman, Drug Policy Alliance‚Äôs California state director, said she hopes this legislative win signals Brown will tackle more comprehensive sentencing reform for drug dealers if he is elected to a second term in November.</p>\n<p>After all, most people, other than law enforcement lobbying groups, now see the war on drugs as well intentioned but overzealous, sidelining perfectly good workers and making it difficult for them to re-enter the legitimate economy.</p>\n<p>So in the coming years, as fires increase and low-level prisoners go home earlier, California will need to make a choice: Pay full price for its firefighting workforce, or send more violent inmates out into the wilderness with powerful tools and very little security.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143395\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"721\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 673px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143395','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-1426-1414694667-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Barr had never used a chainsaw before, and it was lighter in his hands than he expected it to be. Over the course of the spring, as more and more inmates arrived from L.A. County jail, Barr had started to settle into the role of veteran. By the beginning of summer, Holton had transferred the bulk of its state prisoners to help fill spots at other fire camps around California.</p>\n<p>Only 10 now draw from the county jail population, and because lower-level offenders are no longer being housed at state prison, there are far fewer nonviolent inmates available to supply the other 32. Inmates are qualifying who never would have five years ago.</p>\n<p>So the foreman suggested Barr skip a few ranks and move right to the front, as the sawyer. ‚ÄúI got a lot of pull,‚Äù Barr explained. ‚ÄúEveryone knows me.‚Äù He revved the engine and contemplated the tangle of scrub oak blocking the path before him.</p>\n<p>The CDCR says it thoroughly evaluates every prisoner firefighter. But in 2011, before realignment even began, the <i>Redding Record-Searchlight</i>, a newspaper in Northern California, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/inmates-man-fire-lines\">investigated</a> the fire camp population between 2005 and 2010 and found that, despite the CDCR‚Äôs supposedly strict screening, a fifth of all inmate firefighters had committed violent crimes, including carjacking, armed robbery, and manslaughter.</p>\n<p>Of course, there is no perfect litmus test to determine whether a convicted criminal will take the firefighting job seriously, or whether he will just do the minimum necessary to stay in camp. And nonviolent drug offenders aren‚Äôt even necessarily the most cooperative of the criminal population: <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230601065_RISK_FACTORS_FOR_VIOLENT_BEHAVIOR_IN_PRISON_INMATES_A_Cross-Cultural_Contribution/links/09e41501da0e49503d000000\">Studies</a> show those who committed violent crimes are not more likely than nonviolent criminals to be violent once incarcerated.</p>\n<p>The challenge, Barr realized, as one branch, then another, fell to his feet, was in the angles. How were you supposed to know where to start the chop, and which direction to slash in? Surrounded by the stench of gasoline, Barr took another step forward, but before he knew what was happening, the chain got caught on something and slammed to a stop. Still running, the saw convulsively rebounded, bucking backward into his legs with unexpected torque.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTwice. I cut myself twice,‚Äù he said. He didn‚Äôt get hurt, but he did manage to slice through his chaps, which are made from several layers of Kevlar, a material often used in body armor because it is five times stronger than steel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTwice!‚Äù he said again, as though he can‚Äôt even believe he was allowed to keep using the saw after cutting his chaps the first time. ‚ÄúSo they‚Äôre like, you know, we‚Äôll just make you a bucker.‚Äù The bucker walks a few feet behind the sawyer, grabbing the brush as it falls and tossing it away from the flames.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúGood thing I had those chaps,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Trusting an inexperienced criminal with a chainsaw hints at the peculiar, simultaneous empowerment and dehumanization that prisoner firefighters experience. And the use of such powerful machinery is one of the most controversial aspects of fire camp. But most people are less concerned about whether inmates will hurt themselves unintentionally and more worried about whether any criminal should be handed such potentially harmful tools of destruction.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe extend a lot of trust,‚Äù said Lt. Dave Foote, who commands Camp No. 11, in Acton. ‚ÄúThe first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw I thought, <i>Man, I made a wrong decision to come here</i>.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Even a polite inmate, a trustworthy inmate, might be cutting line in the wilderness one morning and then suddenly run off into the woods with his Pulaski axe. When firefighters take custody of the inmates during the day, there are no CDCR guards around to protect them. It‚Äôs just 15 to 17 inmates, alone in the middle of nowhere with chainsaws, axes, rakes, and two or three firefighters.</p>\n<p>Holton is one of only two camps in the state surrounded by a low fence; the other 40 are wide open. Holton is also less than a mile away from Angeles Shooting Range, where you can buy and repair guns, pick up some ammo, or take an accuracy class. Ron Cottriel, the 74-year-old manager there, says he never worries about the safety of his staff and his customers, despite being so close to a hundred prisoners.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúCriminals are stupid, but they‚Äôre not that stupid,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt come in here and expect to do harm when everybody is armed.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then again, about <a href=\"http://www.mendocinobeacon.com/ci_23726595/state-prison-changes-continue-shifting-more-violent-felons\">half</a> the people who escaped from California prisons in 2011 and 2012 were prisoner firefighters. In 2005, <a href=\"http://www.redding.com/news/mother-murdered-officer-continues-pushed-fire-camp\">an inmate</a> walked away from a fire camp in Humboldt County; after nearly two years on the run, he shot and killed a San Francisco police officer.</p>\n<p>Back when he was a state senator, Congressman Doug LaMalfa attempted to pass legislation that would provide more detailed information to the firefighters who take custody during the day about the criminal history of the inmates they are overseeing. Brown vetoed the bill, calling it unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Now LaMalfa worries that we are too trusting, especially given the rising number of violent offenders at camps still supplied by state prison populations. After all, many of the projects that inmate firefighters do during the day, including landscaping at public parks, happen in and around towns.</p>\n<p>LaMalfa asked, ‚ÄúDo you really want your kids to walk anywhere near where that‚Äôs going on?‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143377\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"686\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 638px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:1600px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3495754_4143377','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;The first time I saw an inmate with a chainsaw, I thought, 'Man, I made a wrong decision to come here.'&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr08/longform-original-24366-1414694614-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Wes Schultz</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>As the truck wended its way up Highway 32, Barr surveyed the mountains from the window, noting that there was manzanita up here too, just like near Holton. It was after sunrise on Tuesday, July 29, and he and his crew were a few hours outside of San Francisco, about to begin their second 24-hour shift in three days.</p>\n<p>One of their usual foremen had just been transferred, and a new guy who had never worked with inmates had come to take his place, but Barr wasn‚Äôt worried. He knew what he was doing. This fire, the Web Fire, was a minor incident, having burned fewer than 500 acres, and the one he had worked the day before, the Sand Fire, had been mostly extinguished by the time crew two showed up to do what‚Äôs called ‚Äúmop-up.‚Äù He was only four months from freedom.</p>\n<p>When they parked, the temperature outside was only 70 degrees, but over the course of the day it was supposed to climb to 102. Throwing 40-pound packs on over their gear, they set off on a three-hour hike west into Web Hollow.</p>\n<p>Soon they reached their assigned area at the southern edge of the fire and got to work. Other than occasional shouts to ‚ÄúBump up!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBump down!‚Äù the mountain, the crew stayed quiet as they trekked sideways across the steep incline. It was too intense to talk.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was treacherous, going up that mountain,‚Äù Barr told me. ‚ÄúWe hiked it like three times, then we had to go back down and get water, and then we had to go back up there and sleep, and watch the mountain. The mountain was still on fire.‚Äù</p>\n<p>As the time ticked by, Barr‚Äôs body fell into the rhythm established by a year of grueling hikes and daily practice. The physical exertion, the mental stress, the imminent dangers ‚Äî none of it really bothered him anymore. The only thing he never felt he could fully adjust to and forget about was the heat: the sticky, oppressive heat.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, when Barr got off his shift, he was taken to the nearest fire camp an hour away. He ate some fruit and a breakfast burrito, took a shower, and prepared for his next 24-hour shift, which started the following morning. Several hundred miles from home, he was exhausted from sleeping on the rocky ground, he was dusted with soot from head to toe, and he was being escorted around camp by a tough CDCR guard who cut him no slack.</p>\n<p>But he was comfortable, grateful ‚Äî happy, even, that he didn‚Äôt have to spend this past year surrounded by 131 other criminals in a loud, disgusting room, with <i>Iron Man</i> playing on repeat. Even as he insisted that the experience hasn‚Äôt changed him, as a person, he admitted that fire camp turned the time he had to serve from something soul-crushing into something productive. He does feel angry, though, when he thinks about how much cash he‚Äôll be leaving with ‚Äî maybe $1,200 at most for an entire year of work.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPshh, this might be beyond slavery, whatever this is,‚Äù Barr told me, leaning forward to rest his arms onto the fire camp picnic table. He spoke with more confidence and ease than he had at any point in the past year, casually dismissing the previous day‚Äôs labor as easy in one breath while comparing the foremen to overseers in the next. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have a whip. That‚Äôs the difference,‚Äù he said. He laughed.</p>\n<p>The one thing he did know, as he contemplated what he‚Äôd do once he got out: He didn‚Äôt want to be a firefighter unless he had absolutely no other choice for employment. He‚Äôd never gotten over the physical discomfort of being around the hot flames. Every time was like the first time. It was counterintuitive to get this close to such heat, like jumping into an oven.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not easy for inmate firefighters to make the transition into professional firefighting. Wildland firefighter jobs are so competitive that 200 or 300 applications might come in for one opening, and Cal Fire is reluctant to promote the fact that they might hire well-trained felons over people with no criminal record, even for seasonal jobs. The Los Angeles County Fire Department won‚Äôt hire felons at all. Still, an estimated 3 to 5% of inmates do make the jump, often by working with the U.S. Forest Service. But Barr would really prefer to do something else.</p>\n<p>He explained he‚Äôd been practicing his algebra; reading up on stocks, bonds, and real estate; and savoring Machiavelli‚Äôs <i>The Prince</i>. He‚Äôd also been really into biographies lately because he likes reading about real people who achieve success. ‚ÄúI got plans to be a millionaire when I get out,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI just gotta figure out how.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the end of September, California announced that it had run through the fiscal year‚Äôs entire wildfire budget in only three months and would need to start tapping into reserves meant for all natural disasters. The now never-ending fire season continues unabated, but any hopes that the federal government might offer additional help fizzled in August, when a bill that would increase funding for wildfire suppression died in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Now the state must figure out how to do more with less. And one of the best ways to save money when fighting fires? Send in the inmates. The CDCR confirmed it does plan to open at least one new camp in the next few years.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah, we get exploited as far as the money, but I love going out there,‚Äù Barr said. ‚ÄúIt makes time go by.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143438\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-28764-1414694800-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-28764-1414694800-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2370\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 2322px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3495754_4143438','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/30/14/enhanced/webdr03/longform-original-28764-1414694800-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3495754_4143040\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

The house we‚Äôve been ogling is an otherwise unremarkable, well-tended beige two-story in a neighborhood of similar-looking dwellings in Fontana, a parched, charmless city 50 miles east of Los Angeles. It belongs to Juan‚Äôs cousin ‚ÄúPablo‚Äù (his name has been changed to maintain the integrity of the investigation), whose identity Lozano has been using for years as he‚Äôs eluded detection, living in Mexico with Bianca. Lessan‚Äôs theory ‚Äî or one of her many theories ‚Äî is that Juan and/or Bianca could be in the house today. As she told me yesterday, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my feeling these two have crossed the border and are back in the U.S.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At the moment, though, there‚Äôs no sign of anyone. Three cars are parked in front and Lessan has jotted down the corresponding license plate numbers, but none have moved in the three hours since we got here. We‚Äôre in the backseat, partially obscured by the tinted windows ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf we sit in front, it looks suspicious,‚Äù Lessan says ‚Äî studying photos of Lozano and Bianca so we‚Äôll be able to recognize them should we spot them.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs all Lessan is hoping for today. She‚Äôs considered simply knocking on the door, but ultimately decided doing so could ‚Äúburn‚Äù her ‚Äî if Lozano isn‚Äôt there, Pablo might tip him off, and then Lozano would go even deeper underground.</p>\n<p>Lessan has been a licensed investigator for 21 years but hardly fits the traditional gumshoe profile. She‚Äôs a woman in a field dominated by men and has never worked in law enforcement or the military. From the minute I meet her, she‚Äôs warm and chatty. She‚Äôs slender, with long black hair, and today is wearing a black T-shirt, tight jeans, and sunglasses. Her words tend to tumble out in a stream-of-consciousness rush, and she‚Äôs prone to darting from subject to subject. Often these digressions slingshot the conversation back to Lessan‚Äôs favorite subjects: She hosts a weekly internet radio show devoted to discussing UFO sightings, the Illuminati, weather modification, and the like. On the ride out to Fontana, she casually, almost dismissively, explained how a small group of families, including the Rothschilds, the Clintons, the Bushes, and the Windsors, run the world, and that Dwight Eisenhower shook hands with aliens in 1954.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4088446\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"528\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 480px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4088446','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/13/enhanced/webdr10/longform-28135-1414085047-20.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Deana and Bianca </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Lessan has been working on this case since August 2013, and she represents something of a Hail Mary in this nearly two-decade-long search. Bianca‚Äôs mother, Deana Hebert, whose Twitter handle is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissingBianca\">@missingbianca</a>, has exhausted all of her resources and enlisted anyone and everyone she can ‚Äî the police, the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the DA‚Äôs office, the Mexican Consulate, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, her congressman, multiple private investigators, several lawyers, family members, friends, volunteers ‚Äî to look for her daughter. That they‚Äôve all failed says as much about the slapdash, numbingly bureaucratic ‚Äî if well-intentioned ‚Äî system we have in this country for finding long-term missing children as it does about anything else. As Hebert put it, ‚ÄúNobody wants to be responsible for anything in this case. Nobody wants to be in charge. It‚Äôs just me pushing and pushing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>If you were a parent whose daughter was abducted, how much would you pay for her safe return? Even the most well-meaning PIs must navigate the murky moral quandary of what is appropriate to charge a desperate parent to deliver the very thing in the universe they hold most dear. A friend of Hebert‚Äôs paid to hire Lessan ‚Äî the third PI who‚Äôs been on the case ‚Äî and right now this house in Fontana is her only viable lead. If we see either Lozano or Bianca today, the plan is to call Hebert so she can fly out from Texas to meet the fully grown woman she hasn‚Äôt seen since she was her 20-month-old toddler, and to contact Lessan‚Äôs friend who works as an investigator for Homeland Security, who could arrest Lozano.</p>\n<p>As morning turns to afternoon, Lessan‚Äôs getting antsy. She begins to consider going against her original instinct and knocking on that front door ‚Äî there‚Äôs a yearning to do something, <i>anything</i>, to make the time spent feel like it wasn‚Äôt a total waste. Just as she‚Äôs on the verge of going to the door and potentially ruining six months of investigation, she catches a break: Girl Scouts. Walking down the street are two young girls and a mother, pulling a wagon behind them, going door to door selling cookies.</p>\n<p>We duck down in the van‚Äôs backseat as the Girl Scouts pass by. They ring Pablo‚Äôs doorbell, wait, then begin to walk away, when the door opens. A little girl, about 6 or 7 years old, stands in the doorway.

Or maybe it‚Äôs 350,000. Or 2,000. In truth, no one really knows. The last year a <a href=\"https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/196465.pdf\">study</a> was done by the Justice Department was 1999. It claimed an estimated 1.3 million kids went missing that year and that 203,900 of those were taken by a family member. Those stats have been regurgitated for 15 years, and while there are significant questions as to how accurate they were back then, they‚Äôre certainly next to useless a decade and a half later. (A Justice Department spokesperson says there is a new report in the works, but it‚Äôs not expected to be published for at least a year.)</p>\n<p>The FBI tracks annual crime statistics and <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2013\">reported</a> that in 2013, 462,567 children went missing. Of those, 2,310 were abducted by a noncustodial parent. This is a number that, according to FBI statistics, has remained relatively static going back to at least 2007. It‚Äôs also a number rendered mostly worthless by the methodology behind it: When missing persons reports are filed by law enforcement, specifying the cause of the disappearance is optional.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMissing person entries are made primarily by the local law enforcement agency shortly after the missing person report is made,‚Äù Stephen Fischer Jr., chief of multimedia productions in the FBI‚Äôs Criminal Justice Information Services Division, explains in an email. ‚ÄúHaving the correct name, date of birth and basic physical description is the primary concern. While the circumstances surrounding the incident will be collected as the investigation moves forward, the missing person entry will often not reflect this data.‚Äù</p>\n<p>This partially accounts for the enormous discrepancy between the FBI‚Äôs count and the Justice Department‚Äôs 1999 research. Still, nearly half those 2013 missing child reports <i>did</i> specify a cause, so following that logic, the number of children abducted by a family member each year falls somewhere between 4,620 and 203,900. Maybe. Robert L. Snow, a retired captain with the Indianapolis police who has written multiple <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IXU3JG/?tag=buzz0f-20\">books</a> about kidnapping, thinks even the DOJ‚Äôs study undercounts parental abductions.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt realize that a lot of abductions, particularly family abductions, are never reported,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt want to air their dirty laundry. I have found research that says it could be as high as 350,000 parental abductions a year. ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much apathy. No one realizes how big a problem this is.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089771\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"778\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 730px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089771','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19446-1414092319-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Elizabeth Smart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089821\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"625\" height=\"938\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 542px; top: 890px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089821','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-19850-1414092433-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Jaycee Dugard </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Carl Probyn / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This is pretty much how it goes when it comes to missing children in America. Despite huge amounts of sensationalistic coverage lavished on a few rare cases ‚Äî Elizabeth Smart, Jaycee Dugard, etc. ‚Äî for the most part, hardly anyone is paying attention. This is especially true of parental abductions, which everyone agrees ‚Äî terrible stat-keeping notwithstanding ‚Äî are far more common than the classic ‚Äústranger-danger‚Äù kidnapping most parents live in mortal fear of. (The 1999 DOJ study counted a grand total of 115 of these so-called ‚Äústereotypical kidnappings‚Äù that year.)</p>\n<p>According to Snow, most parental abductions tend to get resolved pretty quickly. In a percentage of these cases ‚Äî again, who knows exactly what percentage ‚Äî the parent is merely a few hours late returning with the child. In others, a call from the police or a lawyer threatening harsh consequences resolves the situation. Sometimes, the abductor has the intent to stay gone but no real plan, and authorities track him or her down in a matter of hours or days. It‚Äôs when days become weeks, months, and even years that whatever systems we have in place seem to break down completely.</p>\n<p>When the abductor leaves the country, the situation grows even more complicated. The Hague Abduction Convention, a 1980 treaty that has been agreed to by 92 countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, sets guidelines for the return of children kidnapped across international borders, but, in reality, even many countries that have signed it don‚Äôt comply with it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen you go to a foreign country, an American warrant doesn‚Äôt mean much,‚Äù says Snow. ‚ÄúA lot of times you can‚Äôt get the local authorities to cooperate. A lot of countries are of the opinion that children are better off being raised in their country than in the United States. The U.S. can try to put pressure, but they don‚Äôt have much leverage. They‚Äôre not going to cut off aid or start a war over one child.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4089988\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"424\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 376px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4089988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/15/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-wide-11937-1414093711-19.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Courtesy of Deana Hebert</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Deana Hebert was worried the minute her then-husband walked out the door with their daughter. The couple were in midst of an ugly divorce, and Lozano had arrived on a Friday in April in 1995 to pick up Bianca for the weekend. Hebert was living with her parents in a small house in Baytown, a Houston suburb, and their custody arrangement meant Bianca spent most of the time with her. Lozano had her on Wednesdays and every other weekend.</p>\n<p>Hebert was born and raised in Baytown, and Lozano had moved there from Monterrey, Mexico, when he was a child. They were an odd couple: He was 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds; she was 5-foot-5, 100 pounds, and five years younger. These days, with all that‚Äôs happened, Hebert has trouble remembering what first drew them together. ‚ÄúI guess he made me laugh,‚Äù she says. They dated for about two years and married a month before Bianca was born, when Hebert was just 21. Lozano lost his job, leaving Hebert the family‚Äôs sole breadwinner. He grew moody and eventually abusive toward Hebert.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe was so scary,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like Jekyll and Hyde. He can be so sweet and then so extreme opposite. If I‚Äôd stayed I would‚Äôve ended up dead.‚Äù She and Bianca moved into her parents‚Äô house, and she filed for divorce.</p>\n<p>Every time Lozano came to pick up Bianca, it was an ordeal. One Wednesday in January, Lozano got rough and dragged Hebert outside. She called the cops and filed charges for assault, but their custody arrangement remained unaltered.</p>\n<p>That Friday in April, Hebert sensed something was wrong. With Lozano scheduled to appear in court for the assault, their already troubled relationship was near its lowest point. Although Lozano and Bianca weren‚Äôt due to return until Sunday evening, Hebert was on edge the whole weekend. When he didn‚Äôt show up at 6 p.m., as agreed to, she was sure they weren‚Äôt coming back. Her mother tried to reassure her.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMy mom goes, ‚ÄòYou know how they run late. He‚Äôs playing games. He‚Äôs probably going to tell you he had to change her diaper.‚Äô‚Äù She sighs. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòNo. They‚Äôre gone.‚Äô And I was right.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090133\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 462px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090133','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/18/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-26855-1414102979-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs two days after the Fontana stakeout, and Lessan and I are driving, talking about the case ‚Äî specifically why and how Bianca and Juan Lozano would be in the U.S. at the moment.

Lozano‚Äôs parents. Her lawyer. The police. The FBI. As the weeks turned to months and eventually years, a dizzying number of government agencies got involved: Besides the Baytown Police Department and the FBI, an incomplete list includes the U.S. Marshals Service, the Harris County district attorney‚Äôs office, the State Department, the Mexican Consulate, and the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat I found is that the agencies don‚Äôt communicate with each other,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo any information I got, I‚Äôd make sure I sent it to the DA‚Äôs detective, Baytown police, FBI, the congressman‚Äôs office. I was the hub.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Managing the investigation into her daughter‚Äôs abduction while simultaneously trying to mourn the loss was not ideal, but during the first year or two she was grateful in some ways to have something to do. For a while, she clung to the belief that the man she once married would eventually come to his senses and bring Bianca back. ‚ÄúI still remember feeling like, <i>Oh, this is going to blow over</i>,‚Äù she says.</p>\n<p>It didn‚Äôt. Her divorce was finalized. After a year or so, the trail was cold. Soon, Hebert was out of money, out of ideas, and trying to figure out how to go on living when her main reason for doing so had been replaced by a giant, unfathomable void.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was so busy at first, involved in everything, and then all of a sudden everything just stopped,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to grieve. I just put everything in a compartment in my head and kind of left it there.‚Äù But she eventually realized if she didn‚Äôt want to live out her days as the empty shell she felt like, she had to start filling them with something. ‚ÄúBeing in my twenties and being single, it was hard when you‚Äôd meet somebody and they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòOh, do you have kids?‚Äô Sometimes it was easier just to say no, because when you tell some people that your child was kidnapped, they say, ‚ÄòOh, OK,‚Äô and just go on with the conversation. Then some people freak out and start crying like you‚Äôve dropped a bomb on them.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Eventually she met someone else and got remarried in 1999.

She scoured the internet for any signs of her or Lozano. The month after Bianca disappeared, she had <a href=\"http://caselaw.findlaw.com/tx-supreme-court/1338009.html\">sued</a> Lozano‚Äôs parents, who she believes have been helping him, and at one point won a $2.2 million judgment, though after several years and various appeals, a retrial was ordered and Hebert, her parents, and her attorney made the decision not to go forward. Years later, she tried to repair relations with his family in the hopes that they could facilitate Bianca‚Äôs return. Nothing worked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two different parts of me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one part that‚Äôs Bianca‚Äôs mom, searching and doing all these things, and there‚Äôs the other part that goes on with life and tries to do normal things. But nothing has ever replaced her.‚Äù</p>\n<p>In 2009, 14 years after Bianca‚Äôs initial disappearance, Hebert turned to her congressman, Pete Olson, for help, and met Kimberli Reed, who was Olson‚Äôs director of casework at the time. They forged an immediate bond: In 2002, Reed had had her own children literally snatched from her in a parking lot by her estranged husband. It took five months for her to track them down, and a year before she was granted full custody.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know what I went through for five measly months,‚Äù says Reed. ‚ÄúI have no idea what it would be like to go through this for all this time. It‚Äôs amazing she hasn‚Äôt gone insane.‚Äù</p>\n<p>By the time Reed met Hebert, the investigation into Bianca‚Äôs whereabouts had deteriorated to the point where it could hardly even be called an investigation.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was dead,‚Äù says Reed. ‚ÄúThere were probably seven or eight years in there that no one was doing anything, except for Deana. Baytown PD had totally written it off. Harris County district attorney‚Äôs office had washed its hands of it. The State Department had closed the case. There wasn‚Äôt a notice or a flag put into Homeland Security for Juan. Mexico knew nothing about the case.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Reed took up the cause, and ‚Äúfor the next four years,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI literally spent every day searching for Bianca.‚Äù She tried to use her clout at the congressman‚Äôs office to knock heads together at various government agencies. In 2009, she helped convene a roundtable meeting that included representatives of the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Harris County DA, the Mexican Consulate, and the Mexican attorney general‚Äôs office, with a representative from the State Department conferenced in on the phone. She asked if anyone could contact and question Lozano‚Äôs family.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAll of them looked at Deana and me and said, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nothing we can do,‚Äô‚Äù Reed recalls. The Mexican representatives told her they did not consider Lozano a criminal because Bianca is his daughter. The FBI said that its hands were tied because it had no jurisdiction in Mexico. The State Department staffer said it couldn‚Äôt do anything and made clear that once Bianca turned 18 and was no longer a missing child but a missing adult, the department wouldn‚Äôt work the case at all.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúEveryone kept saying, ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt do anything until we locate her, and we can‚Äôt locate her so we can‚Äôt do anything,‚Äô‚Äù says Reed. Even if it did manage to find Lozano, the Harris County DA wasn‚Äôt even sure if it would extradite him.</p>\n<p>A warrant for Lozano‚Äôs arrest was eventually issued in the U.S., and a few years ago Interpol, which tracks fugitives across international borders, put him on a watch list. At one point, Hebert discovered that if she could pinpoint Lozano in Mexico, U.S. marshals were authorized to bring him back to the U.S. and arrest him. But the Marshals Office told her it wouldn‚Äôt, ‚Äúbecause the original warrant was filed by the FBI, and the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Office [wouldn‚Äôt] work together,‚Äù Hebert tells me.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere were certain detectives in certain agencies that have been very dedicated,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúOther times, I try to get in touch about something and don‚Äôt hear from them for months. I know they‚Äôre busy, they‚Äôre on other things, this is an old case, but it‚Äôs just frustrating. It would be nice to have one central agency that only worked on missing children‚Äôs cases.‚Äù</p>\n<p>According to Snow, this is a key failing of the current system. ‚ÄúNo one really takes responsibility for abducted children,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a criminal offense, but there‚Äôs no specific agency meant to take these cases.‚Äù Even within the agencies that end up saddled with kidnapping cases, there‚Äôs a distinct lack of expertise. ‚ÄúIn Indianapolis, we‚Äôve got a huge police department, 1,500 officers,‚Äù says Snow. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got no abduction unit. Very few police departments have a unit specifically trained for this. It just goes to a general officer and he handles this like he handles other cases. So that officer has very little experience and training in it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090445\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"658\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 610px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090445','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-21908-1414096119-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">Photograph by Chris Tuite for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs San Diego office is in a modern downtown office building a few blocks from the Pacific Ocean. Lessan is there to meet with her friend, Maurice Wrighten, who works as an investigator in the cybercrimes division. Lessan has known him for 15 years, and he seems willing to help but isn‚Äôt certain exactly how. From a manila folder, she pulls out a copy of a Mexican ID card: It‚Äôs Lozano‚Äôs picture but Pablo‚Äôs name and information, and Lozano used it to get a job in Mexico a few years ago. She then pulls out two birth certificates. One is a copy of Bianca‚Äôs legitimate American one; the other is a Mexican one that Lessan has uncovered, with an alias, ‚ÄúFabiola Suarez Elizondo,‚Äù a birth date of more than a year earlier, and Pablo listed as the father.</p>\n<p>Wrighten studies the documents. One of the many complications of Bianca‚Äôs case is that although she was abducted as a child, she‚Äôs now 21. Technically, she‚Äôs an adult, making her own decisions. Since Bianca‚Äôs broken no laws herself, Wrighten can‚Äôt really investigate her.</p>\n<p>Lozano is a different story. Wrighten says the identity fraud is a way in, but ‚Äúif he‚Äôs using a fake Mexican ID in Mexico, that has nothing to do with us. He‚Äôs not breaking any U.S. laws.‚Äù As long as he‚Äôs in Mexico, he‚Äôs beyond the reach of Homeland Security. He looks again through the manila file.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere might be a way I can do this, but I can‚Äôt tell you how right now,‚Äù he says. He promises to be back in touch. As Wrighten walks us to the door, Lessan thanks him and asks, almost pleadingly, ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù</p>\n<p>He nods. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs hope.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090484\" rel:buzz_num=\"17\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"510\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 462px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:17\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090484','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-20144-1414099062-8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is the one entity that seems best positioned to step into the breach and bring order to all this chaos. Although the NCMEC is ostensibly an independent nonprofit, it gets considerable funding ‚Äî <a href=\"http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34050.pdf\">$67 million in 2014</a> ‚Äî from the federal government. Opinions on its effectiveness vary wildly. Reed says that the NCMEC is ‚Äúcompletely inept.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAll they do is run a website, create fliers, and that‚Äôs it,‚Äù she says. And when newer photos of Bianca were found, getting it to update the fliers proved an ordeal. ‚ÄúThe entire time I was with the congressman‚Äôs office, they essentially did nothing. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs on our website,‚Äô ‚ÄòWe have flyers out there,‚Äô was all they‚Äôd do.‚Äù (A recent check of Bianca Lozano‚Äôs profile on the NCMEC <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMC/803912/1\">website</a> had an updated photo, but in one spot it misstates the date of her disappearance by 17 years.)</p>\n<p>On its website, the NCMEC claims to have helped recover over 199,000 children since its founding in 1984, with a recovery rate of 97%. When I spoke to Bob Lowery, vice president of the NCMEC‚Äôs Missing Children Division, he said the actual number now is closer to 98% or 99%. Some question these figures, noting that the NCMEC takes credit for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù to recover children in cases it had virtually no involvement in. In some cases, these children were never actually missing (merely reported so by a panicky parent), or were returned by a noncustodial parent within hours of being reported. Critics of the NCMEC say it overstates its usefulness to justify its federal funding, and in doing so distorts public perception about the nature of the problem.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to Marc Klaas, who founded the KlaasKids Foundation to aid in the recovery of missing children after his own daughter, Polly, was abducted and murdered back in 1993, he launched, unprompted, into a bitter condemnation of the NCMEC.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a real beef with these characters,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt really go in the field. They don‚Äôt really get involved in any except the high-profile cases. They‚Äôve done more to harm the missing child ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to call it an industry, but missing child nonprofit organizations ‚Äî than any other single entity out there. They work very hard to make sure every dollar involved in missing children goes directly to them. They don‚Äôt share any resources whatsoever, and I can tell you from personal experience they‚Äôll go out of their way to undermine anybody that might threaten their position. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre just guys in the middle vacuuming up money. I loathe the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and think missing kids would be better served if they didn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Lowery, not surprisingly, takes issue with these portrayals.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThose are misinformed impressions about the National Center‚Äôs work,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe work here in the Missing Children‚Äôs Division is much more comprehensive than simply creating a poster and distributing it. ‚Ä¶ All our teams are former law enforcement or social services with a great deal of experience in finding children. We do extensive case analysis work, we work social media, we have law enforcement partners in our building working side by side with us, so when leads come in that need law enforcement activity right away, we‚Äôre getting it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There are dozens of other nonprofits that focus on recovering missing children, though sorting the merely well-intentioned from those actually well-equipped to help can be tricky (never mind the ones devoted mostly to collecting donations, including the Committee for Missing Children, Operation Lookout National Center for Missing Youth, and Find the Children, three of the 50 worst charities in the country, according to an <a href=\"http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/\">investigation</a> by the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> and the Center for Investigative Reporting).</p>\n<p>A few years after Bianca went missing, Hebert met with Mark Miller, founder of the American Association for Lost Children, a nonprofit that, according to its website, conducts ‚Äúhands-on investigations, while traveling in and outside the country performing surveillance and undercover work searching for and rescuing missing children.‚Äù Hebert says Miller convinced another mother whose own children were missing to date one of Lozano‚Äôs cousins in order to try to get information on Lozano‚Äôs whereabouts.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAfter a few dates, in the throes of whatever they were in the middle of, she confessed that she was working for Miller and the whole thing blew up in her face,‚Äù Hebert says. Later, when Hebert was organizing a concert to raise money for her continuing search efforts, she got into a dispute with Miller over what percentage of the proceeds would go to his organization. In the end, she says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know a lot of what he did or didn‚Äôt do working on Bianca‚Äôs case.‚Äù</p>\n<p>(When contacted, Miller says that he encourages all parents to ‚Äúbe on our team,‚Äù and help out with cases other than their own. He contends that although the other mother blew their cover, she did help procure useful information. He also insists that the money he wanted Hebert to donate to his charity was going to directly fund her case. According to Miller, the foundation spent thousands of dollars on Hebert‚Äôs case and she ‚Äúnever donated one penny to the charity.‚Äù)</p>\n<p>With both government agencies and nonprofits often creating more confusion than they alleviate, many parents turn to private investigators. Unfortunately, the world of PIs is possibly even more opaque. Licensing varies from state to state, and in most cases doesn‚Äôt seem particularly rigorous. According to Lessan, the main advantage a licensed investigator has over an unlicensed one is a badge. ‚ÄúTo be honest,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt know that there‚Äôs no difference.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Given this landscape, it‚Äôs not surprising that nightmare stories of PIs ripping off parents are legion. In 2009, an investigator in Arizona was <a href=\"http://tucson.com/news/local/crime/counts-of-wire-fraud-for-local-man/article_a92d794a-f880-5174-be33-c9ce81251484.html\">indicted</a> on five counts of wire fraud relating to charges that he created a fake abducted child recovery company, Delta International, which collected huge fees from parents and delivered virtually nothing in return. Gus Zamora, an ex‚ÄìArmy Ranger whose renown for recovering children abducted internationally has garnered him features on <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/39080442#39080442\"><i>Dateline</i></a> and in <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/11/the-snatchback/307704/\"><i>The Atlantic</i></a>, has also been accused, <a href=\"http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/zamora-and-associates-fraud-conman-ripoff-c610013.html\">multiple</a> <a href=\"http://www.zamoraandassociates.ca/about.html\">times</a>, of defrauding parents.</p>\n<p>Hebert first hired a PI based in Houston a few months after Lozano absconded with Bianca. She says she traveled to Mexico four times with this investigator, who insisted he‚Äôd seen Bianca while doing surveillance down there for her.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe were going to go down there again, rent a plane, hire these guys with guns, kidnap my daughter, and bring her back,‚Äù says Hebert. But she wasn‚Äôt too confident in this plan, and was running out of money. Around the same time, she met Don Feeney, an ex‚ÄìDelta Force commando working in private security consulting, who‚Äôd helped retrieve kidnapped children before. She decided to spend the last $10,000 she could get her hands on ‚Äî money that her mother had to borrow from Hebert‚Äôs grandparents ‚Äî to pay Feeney to follow up on the earlier investigator‚Äôs information. ‚ÄúThey came back and said, ‚ÄòThis is not your daughter and not your ex-husband. You would‚Äôve been in a world of trouble if you‚Äôd kidnapped that girl and tried to come back here with her.‚Äô It was crazy.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090605\" rel:buzz_num=\"21\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:21\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090605','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-18059-1414097587-29.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>In April 2013, Hebert finally caught a break.

She‚Äôd begun to grow suspicious about his past, and after finding the Facebook page Hebert had set up, was concerned Lozano would kidnap her own son, so she took the boy and went into hiding.</p>\n<p>In a series of conversations Hebert and a Spanish-speaking friend had with Norma‚Äôs brother and father, Hebert began hearing the first details of her daughter‚Äôs life, most of them heartbreaking: Bianca had been told that her mother died during childbirth. She lived in fear of her father. She had no idea she was a U.S. citizen and didn‚Äôt even know her real name. She was diabetic, played the guitar, and although she had no formal education, took classes at a music school in Monterrey.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI desperately wanted to talk to Norma because she‚Äôs the only person I know that knows my daughter,‚Äù says Hebert. But Norma‚Äôs family kept her hidden, fearing for her and her son‚Äôs safety. Still, working off these leads, Hebert and Reed found a Russian pen pal of Bianca‚Äôs named Natalia, who told them they thought Lozano monitored all of Bianca‚Äôs online communication. Around this time, Hebert was also directed to some short YouTube clips of her daughter playing guitar.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090506\" rel:buzz_num=\"18\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"301\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 253px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:18\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090506','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/16/enhanced/webdr07/longform-6913-1414096778-11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>‚ÄúThat was when I saw her for the first time in 18 years,‚Äù says Hebert. ‚ÄúI knew it was her.

Hebert has mostly dismissed the possibility that the red-haired woman we saw here days earlier could be her daughter but believes if we talk to Pablo, he might have some clues as to where Lozano and Bianca might be. Lessan wanted to wait to see what Wrighten came up with, and still worries that if she confronts Pablo, he‚Äôll immediately call Lozano with the information. But as Hebert put it during a three-way call with Reed and Lessan the night before, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he going to tell Juan? That I have an investigator? I think he knows that from what we‚Äôve put on Facebook. We‚Äôre not going to be any worse off than we are now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs late afternoon and the plan is to wait until Pablo gets home from work, then knock on the door. If he doesn‚Äôt slam it in our faces, Hebert has given us a letter for him that explains her plight. So we wait. And wait. One of the women we saw the other day ‚Äî short, ponytail, late thirties or early forties ‚Äî arrives home and goes inside. We wait some more. It‚Äôs now almost 7 p.m. and getting dark outside. Where is Pablo? We discuss the possibilities. Maybe he works from home. Maybe he‚Äôs unemployed. Maybe he‚Äôs out with friends. Time isn‚Äôt on our side. Waiting any longer as it gets darker is going to make an already tense doorway confrontation all the more unsettling. Lessan decides it‚Äôs time.</p>\n<p>She knocks on the door and a female voice from the other side asks, ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis is Monique. I just wanted to show you something.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The door opens to reveal the woman with the ponytail, presumably Pablo‚Äôs wife. Lessan flashes her private investigator license and explains that we are looking for Pablo, but refuses to explain why. Pablo‚Äôs not home, we‚Äôre told, but will be soon. The woman asks if Lessan would like to leave a message for him.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can just wait,‚Äù says Lessan. ‚ÄúI prefer to talk to him, actually.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOK,‚Äù the woman says warily. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let him know.‚Äù Then she closes the door.</p>\n<p>So the wait continues, now on the sidewalk in front of the house. We debate whether Pablo will ever come home tonight, what he‚Äôll say if he does, and how long we can stand around out here on a Wednesday night before someone calls the cops.</p>\n<p>By the time Pablo pulls up it‚Äôs past 8 p.m. We walk toward him in his driveway, just as his wife comes out the front door again. Lessan introduces herself and asks if we can come inside to show him some information. He looks at us the way you would look at any two strangers who just accosted you in your driveway on a dark Wednesday night insisting, somewhat frantically, that they wanted to come into your house. Lessan presses the case, asking again if we can just come inside for a minute. Pablo and his wife don‚Äôt look wary anymore, they look downright scared.</p>\n<p>Lessan changes tack and tries to hand Pablo the letter Hebert wrote for him. He recoils from the envelope as if it was radioactive, and mumbles something about not knowing what legal implications might come with accepting the letter. I offer to read it aloud. Nobody objects, so I do.</p>\n<p>The letter explains Hebert‚Äôs entire agonizing, Kafkaesque, two-decade-long ordeal ‚Äî the kidnapping, the identity theft, the fruitless searching, the pain of not knowing. It seems to settle the moment. Pablo and his wife look stunned. Lessan asks if she can show them some documentation right here in the driveway. We move under an outdoor floodlight and she lays out the same documents she showed Wrighten on the hood of the family‚Äôs car, building the case, piece by piece.</p>\n<p>When she‚Äôs done, Pablo shakes his head. He hasn‚Äôt seen his cousin Juan Lozano since they were kids. He doesn‚Äôt know anything about the kidnapping. He didn‚Äôt even know he had been married or had kids. He saw Lozano‚Äôs parents last year when they came to California for a funeral, but other than that, he‚Äôs had hardly any contact with that branch of the family in decades. He expresses a willingness to help find out where his cousin is, but quite sensibly, seems most concerned with the fact that Lozano ‚Äî an international fugitive ‚Äî is running around using his identity.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs possible that Pablo is lying about all this, and that Lozano and Bianca are hiding in the house right behind us, but I don‚Äôt think so. Standing here in the driveway, he and his wife don‚Äôt look like accessories to an international abduction. They look like shell-shocked parents. Lessan thanks them for their time, and Pablo promises to get in touch once he‚Äôs talked to some of his family.</p>\n<p>Back in the minivan, Lessan phones Hebert and Reed. As she drives and talks, she‚Äôs emotional, buzzing with adrenaline. She offers a blow-by-blow account of the evening, pausing every few seconds to take a deep breath, and concludes that it went very well.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHe wants to help,‚Äù she says, exhaling deeply. ‚ÄúHe was very concerned. He wouldn‚Äôt give us his phone number but said, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm going to make some calls and get in touch with you.‚Äô I‚Äôm glad at his response. Hopefully something will come out of it.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4090528\" rel:buzz_num=\"19\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"367\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 319px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:19\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3486784_4090528','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/23/17/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-buzz-wide-6124-1414098123-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>For a long time, nothing does. For months, there‚Äôs no word from Pablo, nothing of note from Wrighten, and after the momentary excitement in Fontana, the investigation has settled back into low gear. There‚Äôs no more money for Lessan. All the leads from Norma have been chased down and come to nothing.</p>\n<p>In late March, I call Hebert and ask how she‚Äôs feeling about the state of the search. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same old thing ‚Äî another dead end,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe spent all this money, and yeah, we made contact with the cousin, but he hasn‚Äôt done anything.

I‚Äôm at the point where ‚Äî I‚Äôm not done, but it‚Äôs getting to be too much.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Then in May, Pablo calls. He‚Äôs apologetic for not getting in touch sooner, but as Hebert puts it, ‚ÄúHe was shocked and felt kind of violated. ‚Ä¶ He has had to process it on his own.‚Äù He suggests the outlines of a possible deal: If Hebert drops the charges against her ex-husband, maybe Lozano would allow Bianca to return to the U.S. and be reunited with her. Hebert immediately agrees. Pablo says they‚Äôd need the agreement in writing.</p>\n<p>Hebert emails the Harris County assistant district attorney, who makes clear this isn‚Äôt something they normally do ‚Äî ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt negotiate with felons. This is not justice‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äî but they‚Äôll make an exception. Hebert sends the letter to Pablo, and for the first time in a very long time, she allows herself a measure of optimism.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWho knows what this is going to turn into, but I have a little hope this is going to work out,‚Äù she says. I tell her that it seems like a smart move for Lozano. Whatever his situation in Mexico might be right now, having to keep hawkish watch over a 21-year-old woman is hardly the same as doing so with a young girl. That can‚Äôt be much of a life for him. Perhaps he wants out.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I think,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverybody I‚Äôve talked to says, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs stupid if he doesn‚Äôt do this. He‚Äôll be free.‚Äô‚Äù She‚Äôs thought a lot about what a reunion with her daughter might actually be like. They haven‚Äôt seen each other in nearly 20 years. Her daughter has no memory of her. They‚Äôd effectively be strangers. Would Bianca move in? Would she call her ‚ÄúMom‚Äù? Who knows, but if nothing else, she‚Äôd know the truth.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHer friends [at music school] told me her dream was to be an American citizen and play music here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverything in her life is a lie: her name, her birthday, her dad‚Äôs name, where he came from. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs got to be a terrible life. She could have so much if she came here.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For the next few days, there are droplets of news. An uncle of Lozano‚Äôs believes the deal is a good idea and will try to talk to his sister ‚Äî Lozano‚Äôs mom ‚Äî about it. Other family members apparently agree.</p>\n<p>Then for a month, there‚Äôs little word at all. Finally, Pablo calls Lozano‚Äôs mom himself but can‚Äôt reach her. He sends a letter to Lozano‚Äôs sister that goes unanswered. When I speak to Hebert in mid-June, she‚Äôs frustrated.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre dragging their feet,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt want to tell Bianca. I‚Äôm not sure how you tell someone their entire life is a lie.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Two more months pass and I call to get an update. Hebert sighs deeply. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt heard from them at all,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to fizzle out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>She sounds as low as I‚Äôve heard her. After all this ‚Äî not just these recent events, but years of struggle with cops, private detectives, federal agencies, a congressman, Mexican authorities, nonprofits, volunteers, friends, family, acquaintances, and yes, journalists, with those who were helpful and those who weren‚Äôt, dealing with a system seemingly incapable of marshaling its best resources to grapple with a problem that should be solvable ‚Äî Hebert finds herself no closer to getting her daughter back than she was in 1995. She hasn‚Äôt exactly lost hope, but having been through so much with so many people, at the moment, she‚Äôs feeling very much alone.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe thing is about stories like this, people will see it, read it, maybe post it on Facebook, but then they move on with their lives,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sitting back here waiting for my daughter to show up.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_embed  buzz_superlist_item_narrow  no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3486784_4082943\" rel:buzz_num=\"1\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t<h2>Want to read more stories like this?

He didn‚Äôt want to show his face on camera, and I didn‚Äôt care whether it was because he was famous, married, or ugly. The internet was so slow that the sound stalled, so the dirty talk had to be typed.</p>\n<p>It was a terse, space-economizing raunch, pounded out letter by letter with his left index finger, since his dominant hand was busy. I WANT TO VERB YOUR NOUN. But the artlessness was a relief. The more work it took to type, the less likely he‚Äôd waste time asking about my hospital bed and IV rack. If I didn‚Äôt mind him being headless and talking like a filthy grown-up ‚Äúsee spot run,‚Äù couldn‚Äôt he handle a naked stranger in a tuberculosis sanatorium?</p>\n<p>Nor did he mention the armband, which hid the nozzle nurses screwed to dripping sacks of drugs during infusions. Three times a week, amikacin seeped down the skinny 2-foot-long tube inside and up my arm, leading behind my collarbone to splash into a big fat artery over my heart.</p>\n<p><i>Just please don‚Äôt fucking ask,</i> I thought. It was exhausting to explain. Screw this guy. Wouldn‚Äôt it be weirder if he <i>had</i> inferred a medical emergency, but resolved not to let it ruin his hard-on? Do virtual strangers without heads even have cognition? What the hell was wrong with this guy‚Äôs face, anyway?</p>\n<p><i>Who cares?</i> I had been in that room in Denver for almost a month. I was days away from lung surgery to remove my upper right lobe, where the bulk of the disease was headquartered. This was the last goddamned time I‚Äôd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars. And it was the skinniest I‚Äôd ever been.</p>\n<p>I had contracted extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB (a severe version of multidrug-resistant, or MDR tuberculosis), while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ukraine. The National Jewish Health Center is no longer a sanatorium, but it is still one of the country‚Äôs top TB research facilities, staffed by worldwide mycobacteria experts and equipped with properly ventilated rooms for the infrequent consumptives who turn up there.</p>\n<p>When I was admitted to the hospital, the state of Colorado dispatched a guy to my hospital room to read me my legal quarantine order. I‚Äôd be in isolation for however long I was contagious.</p>\n<p>During my stay, I started a two-year course of harsh antibiotics, including an IV drip. I had two surgeries, which flanked a blood transfusion and peskily recollapsing lung. I lost 12 pounds and half my blood, which have been replaced, and the upper lobe of my right lung, which hasn‚Äôt. I wish I could be more inspiring. But I didn‚Äôt use that time to write a novel, learn yoga, or even plow through a beach read. Falling into a trance and getting off strangers was all I felt capable of.</p>\n<p>Objectifying? Sure. So is being sick.</p>\n<p>Such isolation ‚Äî both physical and emotional ‚Äî takes a serious toll on TB patients. From the 18th century glory days up to the modern rise of MDR, tuberculosis went from being a relatively universal human experience to being a profoundly lonely one. Isolation and stigma make long treatments even harder to endure and inhibit public consciousness that could lead to more meaningful progress. But we may be approaching a new historical moment: Social media makes it easier than ever for patients to find and support one another. These connections can improve patient morale and treatment outcomes and ultimately raise the profile of MDR-TB in global health policy.</p>\n<p>Because I was never as alone as I thought: Five thousand miles away in Siberia, a woman my age named Ksenia Shchenina was also suffering. So are patients in dozens of other countries, and more and more of them are beginning to use the internet to combat the solitude that has long not only defined the disease and its treatment, but kept it from being eradicated for good.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4041988\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 323px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4041988','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"&quot;This was the last goddamned time I'd ever get to show my tits to a stranger without any scars.&quot;\">\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-592-1413502678-7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Most people don‚Äôt spend much time thinking about tuberculosis. If pressed, they might make a few basic generalizations. It was a very serious disease in the olden days. It killed your great-great-grandfather, all of the Bront√´s, and Nicole Kidman‚Äôs character in <i>Moulin Rouge</i>. But then it was cured. It doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. So we‚Äôll all just have to get Ewan McGregor‚Äôs attention some other way and die of something else.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis has been on the scene since ancient times, but it only reached menace status in filthy, urbanizing mid-17th century Europe. It went on to dominate the continent‚Äôs ‚Äúcause of death‚Äù list for over two centuries. This makes sense, if you know how germs work. Poverty and bad sanitation ‚Äî e.g., the Industrial Revolution‚Äôs toxic work conditions and shantytowns ‚Äî made toppling immune systems a cinch. Before germ theory caught on, some people even saw TB as a sort of moral retribution for the sins of modernity.</p>\n<p>Even the disease‚Äôs classic name ‚Äî <i>consumption ‚Äî</i> implied a physical and spiritual connection. It consumed you; it devoured you from within. Before the scientific consensus on how an infectious disease was transmitted, many people assumed a person could be predisposed to consumption. (They caught on to genetics before they unraveled epidemiology.) An entire family of consumptives probably meant they were ill because they had all inherited the proper preconditions for the illness ‚Äî not because they lived together and coughed fatal microbes into one another‚Äôs food. Similarly, researchers couldn‚Äôt help but notice that consumption disproportionately seized writers and artists, whose lifestyle was practically synonymous with urban poverty. But when it was still assumed that the disease grew from within, many scientists searched for a <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gIAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA32&amp;dq=artistic+temperament,+consumption,+cause&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVRuU_v1HaqhsQTso4GoBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=genius&amp;f=false\">link between</a> consumption and genius. This is the kind of factoid that makes you feel smug when modern doctors are really, really surprised that you got this.</p>\n<p>The jig was up in 1882. A German bacteriologist named Robert Koch zeroed in on the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, the bacterial cause of consumption. It spread from person to person <i>by air.</i></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042155\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"421\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 373px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042155','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr09/longform-475-1413501327-18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Robert Koch </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Ann Ronan Pictures / Getty Images</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Koch‚Äôs early attempts to develop a vaccine failed, but his efforts did yield a valuable diagnostic tool: the tuberculin skin test. It‚Äôs a shot that scans for TB antibodies. If you‚Äôve been exposed to the disease, the injection site on your forearm will flare up into a BRIGHT RED SKIN MOUNTAIN. The test is still part of routine checkups today among grade-schoolers, teachers, cops, and ‚Äî as I would learn ‚Äî Peace Corps volunteers.</p>\n<p>There is a photo of me on Facebook from early 2010, lodged between a handful of party shots with fellow volunteers. We had traveled to Kiev from across Ukraine to make a weekend out of our mid-service medical checkups. I‚Äôm 23, hamming it up in melodramatic distress, and twisting my left elbow up over my head to show off the swollen red splotch on my forearm.</p>\n<p>A positive skin test usually doesn‚Äôt mean you have TB ‚Äî less than than 10% of people with positive skin tests ever develop an active case, because healthy immune systems can usually defeat the bacterial intruder. Several volunteers each year end up with the telltale red blotch; it was really nothing to worry about. We‚Äôd need a follow-up X-ray, but an active case was highly unlikely. So I cracked a few jokes and went back to pounding flat Chernigivske beers with my friends.</p>\n<p>I had been in Ukraine since September 2008, after studying Russian in college. I volunteered at a school in an eastern mining town called Antratsyt. The town borrows its name from anthracite coal. The region is flat, but you can see hills in the distance ‚Äî they‚Äôre ‚Äúslag heaps,‚Äù or piles of debris extracted from mines. The town only runs water for a few hours a day to protect the mines from mudslides or collapse. But life wasn‚Äôt as bleak as it sounds. I had students who were so excited to practice their English that they would chat with me after school, perched in a row on the edge of a Soviet-era fountain long-since bone-dry. I struck up friendships with their parents and my fellow teachers. I toasted my colleagues over champagne and chocolate on Ukrainian holidays. One time, I even gave a thickly accented speech on international education at a school assembly that ended up on the TV news. I was happy.</p>\n<p>My follow-up X-ray was two weeks later, in Kiev. Taking yet another 17-hour train trip felt like an epic hassle. Is there a word that means the opposite of hypochondriac? There should be, because that‚Äôs what I am. In hindsight, <i>of course</i> I had symptoms ‚Äì I just wrote them off to other things. I had a bad cough, because I was a smoker at the time. I‚Äôd lost weight, because there was no American junk food to lose my will power around. I was run-down and sluggish, because it was the Ukrainian winter!</p>\n<p>I got a ride with Dr. Sasha, one of the Peace Corps‚Äô Ukrainian staffers, to my screening at a tuberculosis dispensary ‚Äî <i>tubdispensar</i> ‚Äî on the edge of the city. He spoke the sort of English that made me self-conscious about my Russian. He carried my Peace Corps medical history file on his lap. The most dramatic thing in it was an allergy to mangoes. (Not exactly a significant handicap in Ukraine.)</p>\n<p>I was X-rayed in a machine that looked like an iron colossus. In the waiting room, I tried to distract myself with a biography of John Adams. (His son, John Quincy, spent years in the Russian Empire as Ambassador and managed to stay consumption-free.) Soviet-era medical facilities are much more dimly lit than their Walmart-bright American counterparts. To see the page, I had to squint.</p>\n<p>The head TB doctor finally called me into the office. He explained the X-ray results and prognosis to Dr. Sasha, who relayed them in English to me. But when Dr. Sasha asked a follow-up question, they flipped back to Russian and cut me out of the triangle. My Russian was good ‚Äì but not ‚Äúunfamiliar medical jargon‚Äù good. But this wasn‚Äôt a conversation I could stand to be excluded from. I was on the brink of a tantrum.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúGod<i>damn</i> it!<i>‚Äù</i> I wanted to shriek at the TB doc. ‚Äú<i>Don‚Äôt</i> say it in <i>his</i> Russian. Say it in <i>mine.‚Äù</i></p>\n<p>My face must have looked like a cartoon teakettle. So he slowed down and turned toward the image pinned to the light board.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúClassic pulmonary TB,‚Äù he said to me. (Words like <i>pulmonary</i> and <i>tuberculosis</i> are cognates.) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that it advanced so quickly. Especially for a healthy young girl.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI heard you guys muttering about bronchitis or pneumonia before. Could it be one of those?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo. We assumed it could have been at first, but this is a clear case. See, on an X-ray, healthy lungs should look solid black. See the contrast down by the lower ribs? But now look up on the right. See the [blahblahblah]? The [blahblahblah] is the tuberculosis.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt get that word. <i>What</i> part is the tuberculosis?‚Äù</p>\n<p>He sighed. It would have been easier to let Dr. Sasha translate. Now he had to dumb down his lexicon for a rattled American.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúUp there. Upper right. Well, left on here. That white spot? The part that looks like a ghost.‚Äù</p>\n<p>That night, I started treatment in a studio apartment the Peace Corps rented for me in Kiev. My prognosis was good. For two weeks, I took pills, got X-rayed, and hocked up sputum ‚Äî a polite word for <i>loogies</i> ‚Äî into sterile plastic cups for lab work. One set stayed in Ukraine; the other was shipped according to special biohazard protocol to an American facility to better coordinate my care at home.</p>\n<p>Eight weeks later, just as life was settling down back in Chicago, I was surprised to find an ominous number of missed calls on my phone: from the diagnostic lab, my mom, my American pulmonologist, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health, my mom, my mom, the Cook County Department of Public Health Epidemiology Unit, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom, my mom.</p>\n<p>Those loogies had yielded bad news. I had XDR-TB. The bad kind.</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, I was placed under an isolation order. I was told to stay home whenever possible ‚Äî I could go outside sparingly, but any other indoor space was off-limits until I was noninfectious. A few months, at least. The police could get involved if I didn‚Äôt comply.</p>\n<p>A month into my quarantine, my Chicago doctors were stumped. They‚Äôd rarely seen anything like this.</p>\n<p>So I set off on a journey not unlike those taken by consumptives a century before. I left my bustling, industrial Midwestern city and headed west, to the National Jewish Health Center in Denver.</p>\n<p>It was the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives back then. In 1899, the brand-new philanthropic institution was brimming with needy patients. In 2010, I was the only one.</p>\n<p>I told almost no one where I was going. I had already been avoiding friends who tried to contact me. It is exhausting to have your life flipped around by something people know nothing about. You get so damn sick of telling the story. Weird caveats demand exposition. <i>Here is what I have. Here is why it‚Äôs bad. Here is why I had to evacuate Ukraine and leave the Peace Corps early. Here is why I can‚Äôt be in public or see anyone for the foreseeable future. Here is why I am going to some hospital in Denver for a long time. Here is why they chopped off a big chunk of my lung. Here is why I have this IV armband thing for nine months. Here is why I puke a lot. Here is why food tastes all wrong. Here is why my hearing got warped. Here is why I can‚Äôt feel my toes. Here is why I am not supposed to drink any alcohol. Here is why I‚Äôm still going to anyway.</i></p>\n<p>Since I was on the no-fly list, we drove the 15 hours by car. I wore a mask the whole time so I wouldn‚Äôt infect my parents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4041995\" rel:buzz_num=\"5\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 369px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:5\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4041995','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr02/enhanced-buzz-wide-18705-1413501155-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives c. 1920 </span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Basic infection control, like isolating the sick and using protective gear to lower transmission risk, may seem primitive compared with modern medicine. But the truth is, public health measures like quarantine and mouth covering did more to eradicate tuberculosis than drugs did. We never did figure out a great way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it. That is, until it caught up with us.</p>\n<p>After Dr. Koch‚Äôs splashy 1882 debut of the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</i> the medical community was certain a surefire solution was close behind. But they were disappointed. No cure came.</p>\n<p>Forty years later, a new vaccine ‚Äî Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, or BCG ‚Äî entered human testing. But BCG was never that good. Most researchers believe that adults are just as likely to wind up with TB whether they get BCG or not. It also suffered a major PR setback as the center of one of the worst vaccination disasters in history. In 1930, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749764/\">73 babies died of tuberculosis meningitis</a> after being injected with BCG in Lubeck, Germany. The vaccines had been contaminated after getting mixed up with a virulent live TB strain back at the lab. (Life hack: Always be <i>sure</i> your doctor has a label maker.)</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until 1943 that a <a href=\"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/25252/title/The-discovery-of-streptomycin/\">team at Rutgers University</a> pinpointed streptomycin, the world‚Äôs first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis. TB‚Äôs staggering cultural legacy made the discovery a shoo-in for the Nobel Prize, but streptomycin was nonetheless terribly flawed. It was toxic, and patients quickly developed antibodies that resisted the drug. The only solution was to scrape around for more options and blitzkrieg every case of TB with several so-so drugs at once. The first-line regimen has hardly been tweaked in nearly 50 years. It was never a secret that such a long and tedious course of antibiotics would, like a Shakespearean hero, engineer its own demise.</p>\n<p>But that hardly seemed to matter. By the time streptomycin ‚Äòn‚Äô friends showed up, barely anyone even needed them. Throughout the 20th century, people gradually stopped getting TB in the first place. We got healthier, cleaner, and smarter. We could contain disease and catch it early. It nearly disappeared.</p>\n<p>Then, in the early 1990s, it bounced back. Two global crises ‚Äî the rise of HIV/AIDS and the fall of the Soviet Union ‚Äî helped resurrect the scourge of the 19th century. The World Health Organization declared a worldwide TB emergency in 1993. (It just goes to show: Don‚Äôt count your eradicated diseases before they hatch.)</p>\n<p>AIDS was even harder on human bodies than the Industrial Revolution had been, and millions of centuries-won immune systems were suddenly wide open to infection anew. TB remains the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/hiv/en/\">leading cause</a> of death among AIDS patients.</p>\n<p>The collapse of the USSR spread TB in even more complicated ways. The year 1991 saw the traumatic birth of 15 brand-new post-Soviet republics. Each of these new countries was in economic and social turmoil. They were broke. They had no central government or public health system. Before their independence, everything had more or less filtered through Moscow. In some places, there were few to no supplies or institutional infrastructure, let alone money for health care workers. Alcoholism and malnourishment soared. People lost their savings. Rampant crime stuffed the prisons ‚Äî notorious hotbeds of TB ‚Äî to well over capacity. Released inmates carted these germs back to their communities. By the time the 15 new countries had smoothed things out, they already had a new old epidemic to battle.</p>\n<p>Even as the immediate post-Soviet crisis improved, other factors played into treatment interruption and new infections. These have been beautifully documented by experts like Dr. Lee Reichman in his 2001 book <i>Timebomb</i> and are easily rattled off by every post-Soviet MDR expert I‚Äôve come across. Treatment in prisons has been badly underfunded, so for years people didn‚Äôt get the meds they needed. There is often subpar follow-up for ill prisoners after they‚Äôre released. Infected migratory workers are tough to treat and track. The Soviet-era mentality of medical specialization has made the region slow to coordinate HIV and TB care. Both illnesses are also correlated with substance abuse, and addicts often turn out to be less-than-diligent patients. In sum, the long, hard treatment places economic, social, and physical strain on patients.</p>\n<p>Antibiotic treatment is an all-or-nothing game. Patients need to take every dose by the book, or germs acquire resistance. Getting it done right depends on stupendous public health programs, not to mention stupendous patients. Once a strain does acquire resistance, it can‚Äôt be undone ‚Äî and the stronger, harder-to-treat germ is passed on to others, like me. If the best drugs don‚Äôt work, doctors are forced to use drugs that are even harder on the body. All of these factors collude to paint a grim reality. In former Soviet countries, <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf?ua=1\">only around 60% of patients</a> who begin tuberculosis treatment ever successfully finish it. The rest of them flee, slip through the cracks, fail to respond to treatment, or die before they are cured.</p>\n<p>So it is no surprise that the region has the highest rates of MDR-TB in the world ‚Äî <a href=\"http://www.pih.org/blog/tuberculosis-in-russia-a-qa-with-expert-oksana-ponomarenko\">as many as 30%</a> of all newly detected cases are impervious to first-line drugs. (The global average is reportedly <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr13_executive_summary.pdf?ua=1\">less than 5%</a>, but statistics are widely believed to be low, especially in resource-poor countries. In the U.S., there were <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6311a2.htm\">fewer than 100 cases</a> of MDR in 2013.) Even in optimal conditions, the difference between a case of run-of-the-mill TB and MDR can be the difference between a moderate inconvenience and a life-threatening catastrophe. A standard case can be cured for less than $100 with a daily dose of four different drugs for six to nine months. My treatment cost taxpayers seven figures and lasted well over two years.</p>\n<p>On paper, many of these problems have already been fixed. A decade ago, Tracy Kidder‚Äôs best-seller <a href=\"http://www.tracykidder.com/books/mountains/\"><i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i></a> lauded the achievements of Dr. Paul Farmer‚Äôs <a href=\"http://www.pih.org\">Partners in Health</a> and other global health organizations in revolutionizing worldwide MDR-TB care. The region‚Äôs TB programs are now relatively well-organized and padded with funding from global health mammoths like the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a>. There are detailed and standardized treatment guidelines. TB drugs are fully subsidized. So why are so many patients still failing their treatments?</p>\n<p>Without an <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/toward-an-effective-tuberculosis-vaccine/380807/\">effective vaccine</a> or better drugs, efforts to curb MDR-TB face a serious paradox. As a strain becomes more resistant, it becomes simultaneously more painful and more urgent to treat it. Many countries have responded by adopting stringent patient monitoring policies, which improve cure rates but are nonetheless no small imposition in patients‚Äô lives. Public safety overrides patient agency, which is a tough pill for victims to swallow (and they‚Äôve already got plenty of those to worry about).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042055\" rel:buzz_num=\"6\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/longform-4339-1413500894-18.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"413\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 365px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:6\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042055','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"We never did figure out a way to cure TB; we just got better at preventing it.

Nausea became my baseline. Sometimes the drugs make you puke, or give you the kind of diarrhea that makes you need a nap. One screws with your nervous system, and I permanently lost most of the feeling in my feet. I‚Äôve tracked blood across kitchen floors because I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôve stepped on shattered glass.</p>\n<p>And I had it lucky. I had no comorbidities like HIV or diabetes, which make everything even worse. Being on amikacin cost me some low-frequency hearing, but it has caused deafness in others. And I got to take it by IV drip, instead of the painful upper-thigh injections that leave some patients too sore to sit up. And while cycloserine ‚Äî a drug nicknamed ‚Äúpsychoserine‚Äù for its notorious mental and behavioral effects ‚Äî makes some patients hallucinate and scream, I got away with confusion. I had trouble with reading, organization, and paperwork. It‚Äôs an especially tough break if you‚Äôre dealing with a workers‚Äô comp claim for a medical disaster. I couldn‚Äôt keep it all straight, and walloped my credit.</p>\n<p>Even worse, most patients in former Soviet countries and across the world get practically no social support during the crisis. They get little help with side effects, and suffer serious social and economic strain. Many of them have no way to make up for lost wages over the course of their treatments. Some even face lasting discrimination. In 2011, <a href=\"http://dnews.donetsk.ua/2011/09/21/8967.html\">an undercover Ukrainian journalist</a> wrote an expos√© about being iced out by hiring managers after casually mentioning a past bout of TB.</p>\n<p>The reason why boils down to one key factor: Tuberculosis remains highly stigmatized throughout the world. In the former Soviet Union, people associate it with painful memories of the lawless, chaotic ‚Äò90s. Having it means you‚Äôre a crook, a junkie, a drunk, a bum, or a sewer rat.</p>\n<p>Stigma makes epidemics worse ‚Äî it gives people a reason not to be seen walking into a clearly labeled TB clinic to see a doctor when they should. Loneliness and despair can convince someone that health doesn‚Äôt matter, so why take these pills? And stigma shuts people up, so they‚Äôll never organize, influence funding, or change minds about TB. Stigma means more stigma.</p>\n<p>When patients are silenced and isolated from one another and their communities, it stymies progress against the disease. The WHO estimates more than a $1.3 billion worldwide <a href=\"http://www.who.int/tb/WHO_GF_TB_financing_factsheet.pdf\">funding gap in TB research and development</a>, and the number threatens to grow. Even though investment in new drug research is one obvious way to improve treatment, <a href=\"http://www.tbonline.info/media/uploads/documents/community_letter_to_astrazeneca_re_tb.pdf\">AstraZeneca</a>, Novartis, and Pfizer recently pulled a combined $50 million out of the fight. According to an email from the <a href=\"http://www.treatmentactiongroup.org\">Treatment Action Group</a>, a TB and HIV advocacy nonprofit, this steep loss amounts to a full third of private-sector TB investment since 2011.</p>\n<p>Erasing stigma, combating TB‚Äôs chronic underfunding, and promoting new research and drug development are incredibly lofty goals. But similar barriers have been conquered before in diseases like breast cancer and HIV/AIDS, where passionate activism made incredible inroads in raising awareness and influencing policy. If former and current TB patients joined together, could they build the first real advocacy movement centered on patients?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042061\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1018px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042061','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr01/longform-original-17359-1413502421-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Tuberculosis patients haven‚Äôt always felt so alone.</p>\n<p>After leaving Denver, I read <i>The Magic Mountain,</i> Thomas Mann‚Äôs sprawling 1924 classic novel about a Swiss sanatorium. I forced myself to finish it, but it‚Äôs the most boring book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs the story of a total wiener named Hans Castorp who goes on a trip to hang out in the Alps and visit his TB-stricken cousin. Then Hans ends up sticking around and living there for seven years even though he doesn‚Äôt really have tuberculosis, just so he can do stupid crap like spend 70 pages talking about the nature of consciousness.</p>\n<p>Ugh, I‚Äôm still so <i>mad</i> at him. But maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a tiny bit jealous. So what if he‚Äôs a fake person with fake tuberculosis? It would have been so nice to have someone to be sick with.</p>\n<p>Sanatoriums, like National Jewish and the one atop <i>The Magic Mountain</i>, bridged the gap between the mid-19th century and the 1940s discovery of streptomycin. With no cure in sight, the ill had long made do with an iffy array of treatment options. Some doctors stuffed people‚Äôs windpipes with vacuum contraptions to simulate lazy lung capillaries. Cottage industries of miracle cures gorged on ad space in periodicals, sandwiched among serial installments of now beloved classics. (If you liked <i>Great Expectations</i>, you‚Äôll love Daffy &amp; Son‚Äôs Natural Miracle Multi-Purpose Health Elixir! Available wherever fancy wool top hats and snuff boxes are sold!!!<i>)</i> But the White Plague seemed to beat them all.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis did have one semi-formidable opponent, though ‚Äî one hope that physicians agreed on. It wasn‚Äôt a cure; it wasn‚Äôt a given. The idea came from an <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">1840 pamphlet</a> written by Dr. George Bodington, a British family doctor who covered a large area by making his house calls on horseback. His essay was based on a simple observation: that consumptives in wide-open spaces fared better than those packed tightly in cities.</p>\n<p>But Dr. Bodington drew a further conclusion: It must have been the country air that healed them. Their bodies need pure, unsoiled air, shared with as few people as possible. Depending on the severity of their case, they might need months or years of it. In the disease‚Äôs final stages, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> finally chews through the lung tissue, resulting in the bloody cough that famously beckoned death (but, curiously, couldn‚Äôt stop the heroines of <i>Les Mis√©rables</i>, <i>La Boh√®me,</i> and <i>La Traviata</i> from singing). If combated early with the right dose of air, the process could drag to a halt.</p>\n<p>And where could patients find such magic air? The best stuff was nippy, clean, and thin. Way up high, where no one can spoil it with industrial factory smog. And so, for the next 100 years, sick city-dwellers left their crowded hubs by the thousands and set off for specialized tuberculosis hospitals in the mountains. These sanatoriums treated patients with Dr. Bodington‚Äôs ‚Äúrest cure‚Äù ‚Äî medical observation, a generous binge diet, and hours a day in rows of canopied outdoor beds. In <i>The</i> <i>Magic Mountain,</i> characters traveled to Switzerland from places like England, Italy, and Poland. For months or years at a time, consumptives at sanatoriums lived and breathed together far away from real life, in their own little communities up in the sky.</p>\n<p>Denver ‚Äî the Mile High City, full of its own magic mountains ‚Äî thus became America‚Äôs magnet for the dying who wanted to live. In the late 19th century, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_6024584\">nearly a third</a> of Colorado‚Äôs population suffered from tuberculosis, after journeying west for the air that might save them. At the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, they slept two by two, tucked into each of its dozens of bunk beds.</p>\n<p>By the time I showed up, the bunk beds were long gone. There were no pretty canopies or breezy napping patios. And all that oh-so-edifying ‚Äúvirgin air‚Äù stuff? Turned out to be bunk. The bump in survival rates among patients who spent all that time outdoors wasn‚Äôt because of the air; it was the sun. Vitamin D is good for the immune system. They could have gotten the same effect on the roof of a tenement house. Or by taking sunshine stuffed into Vitamin D pills, like I did, supplemented by the UV light in my hospital room. (In a 21st century American city, you don‚Äôt just let a case of active tuberculosis run around outside.) Other times, patients‚Äô health improved simply because sanatoriums gave them a badly needed break from lives of poverty and labor.</p>\n<p>Still, the sanatorium era continues to be considered a public health success. Not because sanatoriums ever did much to help ‚Äúlungers.‚Äù But because they kept them away from healthy people. By shooing contagious patients off to remote treatment complexes, Dr. Bodington had inadvertently pioneered the concept of infection control. Keeping sick people away from vulnerable populations seems so obvious now. But back then, would the idea of germs ‚Äî invisible, flying disease pods ‚Äî have sounded any less silly than magic air?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042063\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"363\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 315px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share fb sub-buzz-facebook-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/facebook/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'fb-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share tw sub-buzz-twitter-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/twitter/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'tw-share':{'id':'3480022_4042063','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title='\"From the 18th century to today, TB went from being a universal human experience to a profoundly lonely one.\"'>\n\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr04/enhanced-buzz-wide-8518-1413501196-21.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Tuberculosis treatment in 1942 </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">D.

My mom made the appointment. I didn‚Äôt really want to go; I‚Äôve never liked therapy.</p>\n<p>But I hated doing this to my mom. This wasn‚Äôt just my crisis; it was my family‚Äôs too. And it was harder on my mom than anyone. She‚Äôd just spent 10 days next to me on a cot in the Denver ICU after my first lung surgery went wrong. She‚Äôd held my hand when the stiff chest tube draining blood from my lungs made breathing hurt so badly I got tunnel vision. She‚Äôd lost so much weight and was thinner than I‚Äôd ever seen her. So when she kept insisting that I talk to someone, I figured I could force myself to muster an hour of sincerity. And if I didn‚Äôt like it, I could lie, quit, and just find my own answers in some book.</p>\n<p>I got to the office and we made our introductions. Then I broke the ice.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHas anyone ever told you that you look like Laura Linney?‚Äù I asked.</p>\n<p>She paused. For too long.‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve actually never gotten that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve actually never gotten that.‚Äù</p>\n<p><i>BULLSHIT. She looks</i> exactly <i>like Laura Linney.</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúI spoke to your mother on the phone. She said you contracted tuberculosis while you were in the Peace Corps in Russia?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNo, I was in Ukraine. But yes. I mean, it was the Far East. The Russian-speaking part.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd so you‚Äôre going through chemo now? How long is that?‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWell, I was hospitalized in Denver and got the part of my lung removed with the TB on it last month. So now I‚Äôm on chemo. It‚Äôs the IV drip. None of the radiation stuff. And I never lost my hair. So I don‚Äôt know if it even counts. I have nine months of that, and a total of two years or so on everything else.‚Äù</p>\n<p><i>OK, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm uniquely hyperaware of Laura Linney or something. There‚Äôs no way I could be the first person to notice.</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúAnd then‚Ä¶it goes away?‚Äù she asked.</p>\n<p><i>Wait, is she pissed? Why? It‚Äôs a compliment, right? Hold on. Does she just, like, hate Laura Linney?</i></p>\n<p>‚ÄúKnock on wood. It can come back, hypothetically,‚Äù I recited. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they treat it so aggressively. They just want to make sure that it‚Äôs really, really dead. But they can‚Äôt, like, promise you anything.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I went back once or twice for additional sessions. I tried to explain that I wasn‚Äôt scared about dying or anything. By then, doctors seemed confident that I wouldn‚Äôt. But I had this anxiety I couldn‚Äôt shake. I wanted closure in Ukraine, and the people in my town. I wanted to be moving toward something. I tried to convert the emotional fallout into a momentum that more closely resembled psychosis. I took 36 practice LSATs but was hospitalized the day of the test. But panic was a problem I couldn‚Äôt obsess my way out of. I‚Äôd pick up a book but just hold it in my lap and forget what the hell it was for. I had no job and no idea what to do with myself. I lived with my parents, who at that moment seemed to be trying to keep me alive by never letting me out of their sight. I felt timid and stuck. I felt cheated out of that rosy immortality my friends had. All those toxic meds made me feel like someone else. I was very, very tired. And I felt like I was failing. I wanted my sense of control back. I was so damn sad.</p>\n<p>My mom picked that therapist because she specializes in treating patients with life-interrupting illnesses, like MS or cancer.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt can be hard for people to lose their control,‚Äù the therapist told me. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs something I suggest that people can do to feel like they have some power over everything. Next time you go for an infusion, try to close your eyes and think of the chemicals in the drugs coursing through you, attacking all of the bad cells. And concentrate on them, and <i>really</i> see them. Then, envision the chemo forcing them out of your body. Picture them floating away.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I skipped my next appointment and never rescheduled. It wasn‚Äôt a therapist that I wanted. I wanted to connect with other patients like me.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042069\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"1289\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 1241px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042069','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-840-1413500295-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_no_caption\">llustration by Ashley Mackenzie for BuzzFeed</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm not the only person to conclude that TB patients may be uniquely equipped to help each other. In 1907, a Boston-area internist named Dr. Joseph Pratt had the same idea while searching for innovative treatment alternatives for TB patients who couldn‚Äôt afford faraway sanatoriums. He had the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2112765\">hippy-dippy idea</a> that bringing patients together could replicate the revitalizing effects of places like the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives, and help patients heal. Couldn‚Äôt they guide each other through the experience better than any doctor could?</p>\n<p>Pratt tested his hunch with a trial of a dozen patients. Modern medicine‚Äôs first recorded support group was deemed a success. Moral support really did help combat tuberculosis. His destitute patients had made do without the magic air that wasn‚Äôt really magic and replaced it with something that was.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs one thing the sanatorium era got right that today‚Äôs TB control programs get wrong: the need for community. Today, the sanatorium era is thought of as a relic of medical quackery rendered moot by modern science. But to mock it in favor of enlightened antibiotic cures is to dismiss the lived experience of patients. For all their problems, sanatoriums were designed to heal patients. Today, treatment is primarily concerned with limiting threats posed to others. Patients‚Äô lives are collateral damage.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw no_caption \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042128\" rel:buzz_num=\"11\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"328\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 280px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:11\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042128','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr08/enhanced-buzz-wide-10741-1413501020-26.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>I showed up at the radiology department of George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for my final chest X-ray in late spring of 2012. I stood in the yellow foot outlines and assumed the TSA body scan position without even waiting for the technician‚Äôs spiel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre an old pro, then!‚Äù he said from the processing room. ‚ÄúOK, deep breath and hold it‚Ä¶ Good‚Ä¶ Now let‚Äôs just make sure that‚Ä¶ <i>Whoa,</i> you‚Äôre missing a big part of your lung! Sorry, wasn‚Äôt expecting that!‚Äù That makes two of us.</p>\n<p>But the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> had indeed been destroyed. What was left of my lungs showed up as solid black ‚Äî just as a healthy X-ray is supposed to be.</p>\n<p>But somehow, it wasn‚Äôt as satisfying as I‚Äôd hoped. Once again, I wanted to share the moment with someone who understood what it meant. Moral support is nice for the good stuff too.</p>\n<p>I began to find out how many patients felt the same way in June 2013, when I finally went back to Ukraine. I made a ring around the country to gather data for my master‚Äôs thesis: I traveled to Kiev, Lviv, Crimea, Mariupol, Kharkhiv, Lugansk, Donetsk, and my beloved Antratsyt. I visited hospitals, clinics, and met doctors, health care and nonprofit workers, and, of course, patients. No matter who they were, tuberculosis had a profound impact on their lives. Many had lost friends or even family members over their illness, or felt forced to keep the experience secret. Loneliness and shame were practically the default.</p>\n<p>For as long as I‚Äôd spent surviving and learning about tuberculosis, one big question stuck in the back of my mind. I posed it to Oksana Viktorovna, a training coordinator for the <a href=\"http://stoptb.in.ua/en/\">Stop TB in Ukraine</a> initiative in Donetsk. Why, I asked her, is there so little communication and coordination within the TB patient community, and so much of it ‚Äî working successfully, by the way ‚Äî in other diseases?</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúPeople are ashamed to be associated with the fringe. And even though TB is curable, the stigma makes them think it would be better to have cancer.‚Äù And perhaps, she continued, people who survive TB are ready to forget it and move on.</p>\n<p>But, this might be changing, Oksana said. Lately, she‚Äôd noticed a few groups pop up online, on Russian networking sites like LiveJournal and VKontakte. Some people even created entirely new accounts to be able to discuss their lives with tuberculosis anonymously. ‚ÄúThey write about their experience, their worries, their questions,‚Äù Oksana told me. ‚ÄúIt seems to increase their optimism. I think it helps them get better.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The clandestine online TB clubs were easy to find. As soon as I started poking through them, I found someone my age from Khabarovsk, Russia, whom I felt like I already knew.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lfcw  \" id=\"superlist_3480022_4042124\" rel:buzz_num=\"10\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-wide-29875-1413500990-20.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/16/19/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-buzz-wide-29875-1413500990-20.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"990\" height=\"381\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 907px; top: 333px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:10\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares_wrapper\" style=\"width:990px;\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"pullquote_shares align_left style_light_transparent\">\n\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pull_quote_share pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pullquote\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3480022_4042124','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"Stigma shuts people up so they'll never organize, influence funding or change minds.

Even in the tourist-thick crowd by the famous Tretyakov Gallery, she wasn‚Äôt hard to spot. By now we‚Äôd already spent hours of our lives talking on Skype.</p>\n<p>Ksenia maintains a <a href=\"http://stoptub.livejournal.com\">patient-centered website</a> about TB, as well as pages in English and Russian across several social media platforms. Her project‚Äôs slogan, ‚ÄúBeing ill isn‚Äôt shameful,‚Äù challenges the negative cultural narratives about TB and the people who have it. Visitors can read the blog she kept during her treatment and her interviews with doctors and survivors. She regularly interacts with new patients from all over the world.</p>\n<p>Social media has the potential to finally address the long-standing need for support among TB patients. Last month, Doctors Without Borders <a href=\"http://www.msf.org/article/msf-study-highlights-potential-social-media-support-mdr-tb-patients\">published a study</a> that identified serious benefits for users of these online platforms, including <a href=\"http://blogs.msf.org/en/patients/blogs/tb-me\">TB &amp; Me</a>, the organization‚Äôs own blogging portal. Social media, <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0108591\">they conclude</a>, helps MDR patients adhere to treatment, gain back a sense of control, fight feelings of despair and solitude, and educate health care providers and the public. After treatment, survivors like Ksenia can continue to serve as mentors and advocates for the global patient community.</p>\n<p>I strolled with Ksenia across the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge, along the edge of Red Square, and up the fabled Arbat Street. We drifted between languages and talked about being sick.

Even as he ran for office in 2010, he faced criminal charges for <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">renting out apartments that were slummy and unsafe</a>. Midway through his first term, he was caught on tape taking $2.36 million in cash from an undercover agent he thought was a land developer. Co told the agent that for enough money he would vote ‚Äúyes‚Äù on any land-use plans. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs the shittiest can of worms,‚Äù Co said.</a></p>\n<p>Despite Moreno Valley‚Äôs depressed property values, control over its land is actually worth a fortune. Indeed, nearly every major retailer in the world covets the kind of real estate the city offers: empty acres near freeways and train tracks at the epicenter of one of the largest but least noticed land rushes in America.</p>\n<p>This arid flatland, shimmering and indistinct in the heat and smog, is just perfect for warehouses. These are not, however, warehouses as most people think of them. These are massive, <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\">futuristic</a> behemoths that have proliferated on a scale seen nowhere else on the continent to usher in goods from Asia to consumers across a vast swath of the United States.</p>\n<p>Americans have grown to expect the goods they want delivered to their homes or nearby store shelves within days or hours. But all this two-day shipping, click-to-ship, and get-it-on-your-doorstep-by-noon-tomorrow has come at a price, paid by the people who live in the shadows of the mega-warehouses: lung-stunting, cancer-causing pollution and, in some cases, political corruption.</p>\n<p>The underside of our consumer economy can be seen in a tale of two cities, just 20 miles apart. There is Moreno Valley, where developers have shoveled in money to win the political approvals to build new warehouses. And there is Mira Loma, a tiny community already awash in warehouses and suffering some of the worst pollution in America.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúEveryone wants a new flat-screen TV,‚Äù said Ed Avol, a professor at the University of Southern California‚Äôs Keck School of Medicine who has spent the last two decades studying the effects of air pollution on children. ‚ÄúEveryone wants new clothing.

Thousands upon thousands of them, passing through in a ceaseless tide, creating a dull background roar, and contributing to some of the worst pollution in America.</p>\n<p>Although air quality overall in Southern California has improved in the last two decades, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the area has had among the nation‚Äôs worst ozone pollution almost every single year since 1988 and the worst fine-particulate-matter pollution in Southern California since the agency began measurements in 1999.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031008\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"895\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 847px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4031008','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/15/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-10933-1413400823-3.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The well-defined line between the residential neighborhood of Mira Loma (right) and the massive warehouse structures in the area (left). </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Emily Berl for BuzzFeed News</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The community that epitomizes the pollution warehouses can bring is Mira Loma.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOur quality of life is in the tubes,‚Äù said Gene Proctor, 73, who has lived in Mira Loma Village for 43 years. ‚ÄúI wish people shopping in Tucson, Arizona, in other places, I wish they could see the little kids around here, their respiratory problems.‚Äù His great-granddaughter has asthma, and his 3-year-old great-grandson, he said, ‚Äúcoughs like a smoker.‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_large image_lfll  \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4032789\" rel:buzz_num=\"7\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"440\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 357px; top: 369px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:7\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4032789','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/17/enhanced/webdr04/longform-28631-1413410139-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Mira Loma Village, shown in green, is almost completely surrounded by warehouses. </span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Population 21,000, Mira Loma is so small and poor it doesn‚Äôt have a movie theater, a community center, or even a moderately upscale restaurant. What it does have are 90 warehouses and a whole lot of big rigs: <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-seeks-join-suit-protect-public-health-mira-loma\">Trucks rumble through 15,000 times <i>every day</i></a>. In just half an hour on a recent afternoon, 269 trucks passed by the big plate glass window in the front of the Farmer Boys truck stop on Etiwanda Avenue.</p>\n<p>That is more than one every seven seconds.</p>\n<p>Avol, the professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, began visiting the town in the early 1990s as part of a study of air pollution and children‚Äôs health across Southern California. Back then, he said, researchers chose Mira Loma because it sits at the ‚Äúend of the tailpipe‚Äù of the Los Angeles basin, meaning the prevailing winds off the Pacific Ocean blow L.A.‚Äôs infamous smog east until much of it arrives in Mira Loma. So it was rural yet had a lot of ozone and smog. Other places in the study, such as Santa Barbara and Long Beach, were picked because they were thought to boast clean air or because they were in industrial areas.</p>\n<p>When the study began, Mira Loma residents complained to researchers about the smell of dairy cows, herds of which clustered on vast pastures and cow yards. But in 1987, Riverside county supervisors revamped the general plan for Mira Loma, clearing the way for massive warehouse development.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn the course of a few years, the dairies disappeared,‚Äù and what had been ‚Äúopen pasture became streets and warehouses, lined with trucks,‚Äù Avol said. ‚ÄúMira Loma turned out to be a very interesting place to study.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The trucks made the already bad air worse, bringing in diesel particulates, very small particles that can enter the lungs and travel to tissues throughout the body. They are associated with asthma, heart disease, neurological problems, and cancer.</p>\n<p>In Mira Loma, children were found to be growing up with stunted lungs compared with children living in places with better air. Their lungs were growing at a rate that was 1 to 1.5% slower, Avol said, so that ‚Äúafter their teen years, they were about 10 to 12% lower in lung function than children who had grown up in cleaner places.‚Äù</p>\n<p>He added: ‚ÄúWe have no information at this point that supports the idea that they ever catch up.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Studies from other Inland Empire communities are also dire. In a neighborhood near the BNSF rail yard in the city of San Bernardino, Loma Linda University researchers <a href=\"http://www.aqmd.gov/docs/default-source/clean-air-plans/clean-communities-plan/enrrich-final-presentation-6-24-14.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">found</a> that adults have more respiratory problems, and children alarmingly high rates of asthma, even when compared with other polluted communities.</p>\n<p>Warehouse industry officials, along with Barry Wallerstein, the head of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, insist that it is possible to build jumbo warehouses that do not pose a threat to public health. The key, Wallerstein said, is taking steps such as requiring that ‚Äúclean‚Äù trucks service them and ensuring that traffic going in and out does not abut residential areas.</p>\n<p>And yet, time and again, records and interviews show, officials failed to consider health impacts when approving warehouses.</p>\n<p>A 2002 investigation by the <i>Riverside Press Enterprise</i>, the local paper, examined the dozens of warehouses approved to be built in Mira Loma between 1987 and 2000. County planners <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/air-750218-county-pollution.html?page=1\">couldn‚Äôt point to a single one</a> in which they had required a detailed environmental study.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the county said it has ‚Äúimproved environmental protection,‚Äù and indeed as lawsuits from environmentalists and disconcerting health studies have piled up, officials across the Inland Empire have been ordering environmental reviews. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they turn down developers‚Äô requests for more warehouses.</p>\n<p>In 2011, Riverside County officials voted to allow a 1-million-plus-square-foot complex on one of the last pieces of vacant land near Mira Loma Village despite a study that found it would pose health risks to the people living there.</p>\n<p>A local environmental group, the Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, sued. California Attorney General Kamala Harris <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/n256_mira_loma_proposed_complaint_in_intervention.pdf?\">joined the suit</a> on the side of environmentalists.</p>\n<p>The two sides <a href=\"http://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-settlement-protect-public-health\">reached a settlement last</a> year that allowed development to proceed but required local officials and the developer to make the project ‚Äúgreener,‚Äù with electric vehicle charging stations and even a potential prohibition on trucks on the road closest to the village.</p>\n<p>The settlement also contained a provision that feels ripped from the pages of dystopian fiction: Every home in the village would be offered high-tech air filters so residents could avoid breathing the polluted air right outside their windows.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4031743\" rel:buzz_num=\"4\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"978\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 930px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:4\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4031743','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-19704-1413412141-33.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Lillyana Carrasco is pictured here with her father, Daniel Carrasco, as she leans on a new air filter at their family‚Äôs home in Mira Loma, California, on July 12.

Just one-fifth of adults over age 25 have a bachelor‚Äôs degree. When people are desperate for jobs, thousands of trucks driving through their community every day seems more tolerable.</p>\n<p>Then there is the money: Warehouse developers and the retailers that buy or lease from them have it. When they come in, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\"></a>they bring <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1306421-economic-impact-on-cities.html\">tax revenues to cash-starved local governments</a>.</p>\n<p>And developers donate to the political campaigns of politicians who control land-use approvals. <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html\">Unlike the bribe Councilman Co took</a>, much if not most of the money surely flows through legal channels in the form of campaign contributions. But it‚Äôs hard to find an elected official in the Inland Empire who hasn‚Äôt benefited significantly, and in some cases overwhelmingly, from development interests.</p>\n<p>That was certainly the case in Moreno Valley. Population 200,000, the exurb sits 65 miles from Los Angeles. At the eastern edge of town, houses peter out into a dusty brown expanse, stretching to the horizon.</p>\n<p>The flat land, right by a freeway, is the site of developer Iddo Beneevi‚Äôs audacious plan to build what may well be the nation‚Äôs largest warehouse complex, a 41-million-square-foot colossus equivalent to 700 football fields called <a href=\"http://theworldlogisticscenter.com/multimedia/\">The World Logistics Center</a>.</p>\n<p>Long before the undercover FBI operative bribed Councilman Co (and then arrested him), Benzeevi methodically bought land ‚Äî the city estimates he owns or controls about half the developable land in town ‚Äî and helped build a political machine in this city.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi, as he will tell just about anyone who asks and even some who don‚Äôt, believes that ‚Äúthe logistics industry‚Äù is the inevitable next step in the evolution of human economic development, the end of a line of progress that leads from agrarian society to the great colonial empires to Apple, which, he claimed, can be seen as just a really cool logistics company.</p>\n<p>So far, he acknowledged, Moreno Valley has not been a hotbed of economic innovation. But with his help, he insisted, the city can put itself at the center of world commerce.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi has an exquisitely courteous manner, even with those who disagree with him, and a fancier style of dress ‚Äî suits or pressed shirts ‚Äî than that favored by most who frequent Moreno Valley City Hall. His long-winded fervor on the benefits of the logistics economy is so well known it is something of a joke in town.</p>\n<p>But until fairly recently his focus, like that of so many other developers, was on high-end homes that would rise up from the dry scrub as they had in so many other Inland Empire communities before the housing crash.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Benzeevi, reportedly working with Florida-based developer Jules Trump (no relation to the Donald), won approvals for ‚ÄúAquabella,‚Äù an upscale community that would feature estates built around artificial lakes ‚Äî ‚Äúreal resort living, without the hotel,‚Äù Benzeevi <a href=\"http://www.builderonline.com/design/projects/boomerangst_o\">told</a> one publication.</p>\n<p>He even helped convince the Moreno Valley City Council to rename the part of the city that would include the Aquabella community to ‚ÄúRancho Belago‚Äù ‚Äî the fact that ‚ÄúBelago‚Äù is not a word in English, Spanish, Italian, or any other common language didn‚Äôt deter anyone, nor did one resident‚Äôs complaint that it sounded <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312211-press-enterprise-rancho-belgao.html\">‚Äúgoofy‚Äù and ‚Äúlike a casino from Las Vegas.‚Äù</a></p>\n<p>Rancho Belago signs were eventually put up all over the eastern end of town ‚Äî although they were modified slightly from the original design after the city of Beverly Hills complained that they looked an awful lot like their iconic town signs.

The housing market buckled and crashed, and around six years ago Benzeevi and Trump swiveled to warehouses.</p>\n<p>It is easy to understand why. Appetite for warehouse space in the Inland Empire is so voracious that it‚Äôs almost sure money ‚Äî if one can get the land-use approvals and permissions to build.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt takes forever to get it approved‚Äù in California, said Kim Snyder, president of the southwest region for San Francisco-based Prologis, one of the world‚Äôs largest developers of distribution centers. ‚ÄúAnd then sometimes you get sued twice along the way because of some environmental group that contends the wild bunnies won‚Äôt have a place to go, or the desert kangaroo or the burrowing owl or what have you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For a retailer that needs space quickly, embarking on such a tortuous approval process can make little sense.</p>\n<p>So, in contrast to much of the rest of the country, warehouses in the Inland Empire tend to be built on spec, meaning that land developers such as Benzeevi build them and then find companies to rent them ‚Äî which has never been easier because the <a href=\"http://ar2013.prologisweb.com/\"></a><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312846-prologis2.html\">gap between supply and</a> demand has never been greater. In just the first eight months of this year, industry experts said, companies snapped up 15 million square feet of warehouse space.</p>\n<p>Basically, the business boils down to this: Get approval to build, then watch the profits roll in. Several industry experts estimate that profit margins are consistently in the high teens.</p>\n<p>In that context, a developer might like to have as much influence over the land use process as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033060\" rel:buzz_num=\"8\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1059\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1011px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:8\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033060','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/22/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-31029-1413426703-5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">The Skechers factory store and warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

West posed the question as the shoe company Skechers‚Äô national distribution center, developed by Benzeevi, came before the council.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi said that he dumped money into the 2008 campaign because the town was ‚Äústagnating‚Äù and to counter ‚Äúmyths.‚Äù Residents, he said, had grown weary of West ‚Äúcashing in at City Hall while little if anything was happening in Moreno Valley, except for rising crime.‚Äù</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe participate in our American democratic process,‚Äù he declared, and ‚Äúthe voters make the choices.‚Äù</p>\n<p>West lost the election. Those still on the council, he said, could hardly miss the point: ‚ÄúIf there wasn‚Äôt total compliance with Benzeevi‚Äôs plan, he had the resources to remove you.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The Skechers warehouse was approved, and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger <a href=\"http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=14626\">came to the 2010 groundbreaking</a>. The governor mused out loud that he wished Skechers would ‚Äúcreate some maybe alligator cowboy boot running shoes.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The warehouse, <a href=\"http://www.moreno-valley.ca.us/community/news/news_13/031313skechers.html\">which city officials</a> touted as the largest certified green building of its kind in the United States, is more than half a mile long.</p>\n<p>In 2008 alone, campaign finance records show that one of Benzeevi‚Äôs companies, Highland Fairview, donated or loaned <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">more than $260,000</a> to local races that, for years before his arrival on the scene, had been won with far lower expenditures. Another big contributor was a land broker close to Benzeevi, Jerome Stephens, who kicked in more than $100,000.</p>\n<p>The men did not give their money directly to candidates. Instead, they donated it to a political action committee. In the close-knit ways of small-town politics, that committee had multiple connections to city power brokers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_left_small image_lfls  \" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033571\" rel:buzz_num=\"15\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"300\" height=\"423\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 217px; top: 375px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:15\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033571','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr07/longform-30796-1413416511-22.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Councilman Richard Stewart </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Macey J.

At one point, the law firm rented an office suite at Raceway.</p>\n<p>Things even got more entwined. In 2008, as the real estate market headed steeply down, the general manager of Raceway Ford, Tom Owings, sold his four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home with a pool and spa in the more upscale community of Redlands and moved into a rental house at the edge of the town in Moreno Valley.</p>\n<p>Less than two years later, he was appointed to the planning commission, and in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1314017-owings460-063012.html\">with the aid of campaign contributions</a> from Benzeevi‚Äôs ally Stephens, he was elected to the city council. He also received $10,000 from Skechers, which was later <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/press_release.php?pr_id=779\">fined</a> $2,400 by the California Fair Political Practices Commission for improperly failing to report that and other contributions.</p>\n<p>Owings told BuzzFeed News that he sought political office because he believed he could ‚Äúimprove the city‚Äôs financial position and make it a better place to live.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But moving from a grand home in Redlands to a rental in Moreno Valley was notable to some in town, because that is not the usual trajectory for those not in economic distress. And Owings appeared to be doing just fine. According to a <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/form700/2012/City/F-M/R_Owings_Thomas.pdf\">financial disclosure form</a> he filed covering the year 2012, Owings had various streams of income including a salary of more than $100,000 from Raceway Ford. He also held between $100,000 and $1 million in various investments.</p>\n<p>Owings said he changed his residence because his grandchildren, who had been living with him, moved away, and his house in Redlands was too big. He also wanted to sell it before the housing market crashed even further, he said, and Moreno Valley was closer to his office.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúSnobbish‚Äù is how he described people who questioned his move. ‚ÄúPeople in Moreno Valley are like the people I grew up with, and I feel more comfortable in Moreno Valley,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Last year, Owings became mayor of Moreno Valley, a position that rotates among council members.</p>\n<p>The former car salesman, who looks a bit like an off-duty Santa Claus and is often seen in the company of his golden retriever Shiloh, quickly became known for his snappish temper and habit of berating people who disagreed with him.</p>\n<p>Owings said that he wasn‚Äôt beholden to Benzeevi and acted independently of him. But he was viewed as a staunch ally of Benzeevi‚Äôs, a perception that was fed not only by his voting record but also by statements attacking critics of the World Logistics Center.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033156\" rel:buzz_num=\"9\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:9\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033156','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/18/enhanced/webdr04/longform-original-28488-1413413042-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Moreno Valley City Council meeting. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

Councilman Jesse Molina, who had <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312481-moreno-valley-taxpayers-association.html\">received campaign donations</a> from the Benzeevi-funded political action committee<b>,</b> <a href=\"http://www.pe.com/articles/city-644004-valley-moreno.html\">told the Chamber of Commerce</a> in 2012 that he had dreamed of the World Logistics Center his entire life. (Later, he said he meant that he dreamed of a vision for that part of town.)</p>\n<p>Co, the councilman caught on camera taking money from the FBI, was also often supportive of Benzeevi, although in private he could be less than complimentary about development projects to which he intended to give his vote. During a taped conversation with the undercover FBI agent in the spring of 2012, he confided that he had promised a developer ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304718-copleaagreement.html#document/p32/a178655\">he would always vote ‚Äòyes‚Äô on the developer‚Äôs projects even if it was a ‚Äòpissing can.‚Äô‚Äù</a> The federal affidavit does not identify the developer.</p>\n<p>Benzeevi himself said the humungous World Logistics Center represents a chance for Moreno Valley to escape poverty and the long commutes so many residents must make because there are so few jobs in town.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMoreno Valley has a historic opportunity,‚Äù he said in an interview with BuzzFeed News. Life for many of its citizens, he said, is difficult, buffeted by low-paying jobs, endless hours on the freeway, and a choice between making ends meet and paying proper attention to children who must be left alone for hours on end while their parents commute.</p>\n<p>The World Logistics Center, he said, would solve many of those problems. He projects it would create 20,000 permanent jobs and another 13,000 construction jobs, and that it would be the largest ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù development in the United States.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, top city officials had been pressuring staff to push through approvals for Benzeevi‚Äôs projects, even though some of his plans violated the city‚Äôs building code procedures, according <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1312216-earlycase.html#document/p10/a182306\">to a lawsuit</a> filed last year by three former city staffers.</p>\n<p>Those employees claimed they were also under pressure to go easy on a criminal code enforcement case the city had filed against Councilman Co before he won office. His properties had multiple troubles. For example, he rented out an illegally converted garage to not one, but two families with children. After <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1304727-co-arrest-declaration.html\">a child was injured in that</a> garage in 2010, building inspectors found a host of problems including dangerous wiring and substandard construction. The lawyer in charge of his defense in the code enforcement case was none other than Geller, the treasurer for the Benzeevi-backed political action committee.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033361\" rel:buzz_num=\"12\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1060\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1012px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:12\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033361','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/19/enhanced/webdr05/longform-original-4135-1413414476-6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">A construction site in Moreno Valley. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Macey J.

(Benzeevi told BuzzFeed News ‚Äúwe have been working diligently‚Äù to improve the project, and ‚Äújudgment should be reserved‚Äù until the final environmental review.)</p>\n<p>Some were also angry that the Skechers project, which backers had said <a href=\"http://highlandfairviewbusinesspark.com/index.html\">could create 2,500 new jobs</a>, in fact employed only about 600 ‚Äî and many of those were people who had been relocated from the company‚Äôs old warehouse in a neighboring city.</p>\n<p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/pdfs/SupplyChainRBR_B.pdf\"><i>Robotics Business Review</i></a> hailed the Skechers warehouse as being at ‚Äúthe vanguard‚Äù in using new technologies that rely on robots and automation instead of workers for much of the labor within its smooth, white walls. The article noted that the new technologies allowed the company to cut its staffing by nearly 75%.</p>\n<p>Asked about those figures and other matters, Lauren Dutko, public relations manager for the company said in an email: ‚ÄúSkechers has no comment for the story.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Benzeevi called complaints about the number of jobs at Skechers ‚Äúanother attempt to disparage us based on lies and misrepresentations.‚Äù He said there were 1,000 jobs projected at the Skechers warehouse and 2,500 in total at the development, which includes two approved but not-yet-built offices.</p>\n<p>Around the Inland Empire, some have also begun to question the quality of warehouse jobs. Inland Empire economist John Husing, a consultant to local governments and businesses, said <a href=\"http://www.laedc.org/sclc/documents/GM_Husing-whitepaper.pdf\">research shows that</a> the median <a href=\"http://www.johnhusing.com/QER%20Reports/QER%20Oct%202013%20web.pdf\">income</a> in the industry is nearly $44,000 ‚Äî one of the few routes to the middle class in the region for those without a college degree. Many warehouse developers and municipal economic development officials agree with that assessment. But some researchers argue that this rosy analysis <a href=\"http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/WarehouseWorkerPay_web.pdf\">doesn‚Äôt include</a> contractors and temp workers, who make up a large portion of warehouse workers. Advocates maintain that many of these jobs <a href=\"http://www.policymatters.ucr.edu/pmatters-vol5-2-warehouse.pdf\">are low-paid and unsafe</a>, trapping workers in poverty with little chance of advancement, or running them ragged until they get injured.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw   been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3479104_4033762\" rel:buzz_num=\"16\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1071\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1517px; top: 1023px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:16\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3479104_4033762','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/15/20/enhanced/webdr10/longform-original-6749-1413418142-9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Iddo Benzeevi outside the Skechers factory store and warehouse. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Photograph by Jolie Myers</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This was the context, when, in April of last year, boosters and bashers of Benzeevi‚Äôs World Logistics Center once again hustled into the gleaming Moreno Valley City Council chambers.

The prosecution said she should have called 911.</p>\n<p>Collin Grant‚Äôs case illuminates what domestic violence advocates say is a different problem: the collateral damage to the children of mothers sent away to prison for years.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhat are we really doing on behalf of that child who is the victim of the crime?‚Äù said Deborah D. Tucker, <a href=\"http://www.ncdsv.org/ncd_staff.html\">executive director</a> of the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. ‚ÄúHow is that‚Äù ‚Äî imprisoning the mother ‚Äî ‚Äúhelpful to them?‚Äù</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/buzzfeed-media/Images/2014/09/buzzfeednews_failuretoprotectlaws.pdf\">At least 29 states</a> have laws that explicitly criminalize parents‚Äô failure to protect their children from abuse. In addition, prosecutors in at least 19 states can use other, more general laws against criminal negligence in the care of a child or placing a child in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<p>Only a handful of state laws provide specific defenses for parents who reasonably feared they would be harmed if they stepped in to stop child abuse.</p>\n<p>Many prosecutors defend the laws and the harsh sentences as sending a message that mothers must defend their children, even if their own safety is at risk. Domestic violence advocates counter that such sentences are unjust ‚Äî and a sign that the criminal justice system does not understand how battering victimizes women.</p>\n<p>Altogether, BuzzFeed News <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexcampbell/these-mothers-were-sentenced-to-at-least-10-years-for-failin#34hf7pb\">found 28 cases</a> in which mothers were sentenced to at least a decade in prison despite evidence they themselves were victims of their violent partners. Alishia Mackey was one of those mothers. She was tried under Oklahoma‚Äôs ‚Äúenabling child abuse‚Äù law, which has <a href=\"http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=455672\">the same maximum sentence</a> ‚Äî life in prison ‚Äî as actually committing child abuse.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_wide image_lffw no_caption  been_bled image_lffw_bled\" id=\"superlist_3469656_3972975\" rel:buzz_num=\"2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\" style=\"margin-left: -30px; width: 1050px; height: auto;\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"1440\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 1357px; top: 432px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:2\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3469656_3972975','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr02/longform-original-26827-1412712786-10.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>Jimmy Don and Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310036-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt1.html#document/p1/a180881\">married in 1995</a>. His beatings waxed and waned ‚Äî bad in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310037-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt2.html#document/p1/a180882\">early years of their marriage</a>, for example, then <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310040-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a180891\">bad again</a> not long before Collin‚Äôs abuse came to light.</p>\n<p>Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310040-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a180891\">testified</a> that Jimmy Don ‚Äúwould punch me repeatedly, hit me with things, choke me, hold the back of ‚Äî hold a gun to my head, threaten to kill me and my kids if I even told anybody‚Äù that he beat her. A former friend <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310957-former-friend-testimony.html#document/p2/a181339\">told the court</a> that Alishia had confided in her at the time that Jimmy Don was battering her. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310043-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt3.html#document/p1/a181323\">testified</a> that he saw his mom get beaten. She escaped once, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310044-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a180894\">he told the court</a>, but Jimmy Don ‚Äútracked us down.‚Äù</p>\n<p>One night, Alishia woke up <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180897\">to find she was alone in bed</a>. She got up and went to her son‚Äôs bedroom. What exactly she saw is unclear. Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p2/a180905\">testified</a> that Jimmy Don was molesting him, and Alishia <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310106-police-testimony-excerpt1.html#document/p1/a180900\">first told police</a> that she saw Jimmy Don on top of Collin with both of their pants down. But in court, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310100-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a180899\">she</a> and <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310158-collin-testimony-excerpt8.html#document/p1/a180906\">Collin</a> testified that he and Jimmy Don were both clothed.</p>\n<p>On the stand, Alishia changed many parts of her story and contradicted herself. ‚ÄúShe was her own worst enemy,‚Äù David Pierce, the prosecutor, said in an interview.</p>\n<p>That‚Äôs not uncommon. In its investigation, BuzzFeed News found that many battered mothers lie and take other actions that make them look guilty. The terror they feel sometimes lasts even after their partner has been arrested. Then too, repeated trauma, like PTSD, can harm a person‚Äôs mental health. ‚ÄúThere are many times when victims don‚Äôt put their best foot forward for a host of reasons ‚Äî including their own sense of guilt and failure,‚Äù Tucker said.</p>\n<p>Alishia also <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310101-alisha-mackey-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a180904\">testified</a> that she suffered from petit mal seizures that led her to have a faulty memory.</p>\n<p>At trial, prosecutors alleged that the moment when Alishia walked in on her husband and her son came two years before authorities learned of it. Police pointed to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p1/a181201\">an interrogation</a> in which she allegedly said the incident happened <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310733-police-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p3/a181202\">in January of 2002</a>, but officers <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310730-police-testimony-excerpt4.html#document/p1/a181200\">didn‚Äôt tape that interview</a>. Collin testified that it happened in the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310103-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt6.html#document/p1/a4\">fall</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310735-collin-testimony-excerpt-10.html#document/p1/a181204\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310736-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt5.html#document/p2/a181208\">2003</a>, which would mean that the abuse came to light within a few months of her seeing it.</p>\n<p>Whatever the details, prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310739-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a181210\">argued</a> that Alishia failed to protect her son by neither leaving the relationship nor going immediately to the authorities. On the stand, Collin <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310738-collin-grant-testimony-excerpt7.html#document/p1/a181209\">estimated</a> that Jimmy Don molested him ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù five more times after his mother first learned of the abuse and before Jimmy Don was arrested.</p>\n<p>Pierce, the prosecutor, declared in court that Collin wanted his mother put away. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd like to see her spend the rest of her life in prison,‚Äù Pierce <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310176-prosecutor-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180922\">told the judge</a>. Asked about this, Collin told BuzzFeed News he was on psychotropic medication at the time of the trial and, because he was <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310758-judge-agrees-to-screen-off-collin-from-his.html#document/p1/a181214\">screened off</a> from his mother during his testimony, did not realize he was testifying at her trial. He said he thought he was at his stepfather‚Äôs trial.</p>\n<p>One thing that Pierce never disputed was the fact that Jimmy Don had violently abused Alishia. Indeed, Pierce cited his battering of Alishia as evidence of her poor decision-making. ‚ÄúShe made the decision to stay,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1303314-alisha-mackey-prosecutor-opening-statement-excerpt.html#document/p1/a178175\">he told the jury</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310163-alisha-mackey-jury-decision.html#document/p1/a180910\">Jurors found Alishia guilty</a> and recommended 20 years in prison. Alishia‚Äôs attorney, Corrine O‚ÄôDay, protested that the prosecution had sought only 15 years when Jimmy Don pled guilty to raping Collin. ‚ÄúThe state is not fully consistent,‚Äù <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310105-mackey-attorney-sentencing-argument-excerpt.html#document/p1/a180909\">she said</a>. But the judge <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1310175-judge-determines-mackey-sentence.html#document/p1/a180920\">went with the jury‚Äôs recommendation</a>.</p>\n<p>Told that Collin recently said his mother should not be in prison, Pierce said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised with that at all. It‚Äôs his mother.‚Äù</p>\n<p>But that does not change Pierce‚Äôs view on Alishia‚Äôs sentence. ‚ÄúI believe that that was an appropriate punishment for what she did,‚Äù he said.</p>\n<p>Jimmy Don‚Äôs case was handled by a different prosecutor, Sejin Brooks. Now an attorney in Austin, Texas, Brooks said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äù that it might look strange that Alishia, who was convicted of permitting abuse, got a harsher punishment than Jimmy Don, who actually raped Collin. But, Brooks said, Alishia did not plead guilty but instead went to trial, risking the wrath of a judge and jury.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"buzz_superlist_item buzz_superlist_item_image  buzz_superlist_item_narrow image_lfcn  \" id=\"superlist_3469656_3973011\" rel:buzz_num=\"3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\n    \t\n\t\t<div class=\"sub_buzz_content\">\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel:bf_image_src=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" class=\"bf_dom\" rel:bf_bucket=\"progload\" width=\"720\" height=\"660\" alt=\"\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"pinit\" style=\"left: 637px; top: 612px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"pin sub-buzz-pinterest-share bf_dom\" href=\"javascript:;\" rel:gt_act=\"share/pinterest/pin/list-item:3\" rel:bf_bucket_data=\"{'pin-share':{'id':'3469656_3973011','not_a_sub':true}}\" rel:sub_title=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t   \t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t\t\t\t   \t</a>\n\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"print\"><a href=\"http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/7/16/enhanced/webdr11/enhanced-mid-24124-1412715170-13.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>View this image ‚Ä∫</b></a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"article_caption_w_attr\"><span class=\"sub_buzz_desc\">Visitors leave the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in McLoud, Oklahoma. </span> <span class=\"sub_buzz_source_via buzz_attribution buzz_attr_w_caption\">Sue Ogrocki / AP Photo</span></p>\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n<p>The courthouse would be the last place Collin saw his mother for more than five years, until he turned 18.
