But even as the publisher and retailer announced a negotiated peace after sparring since January, hardly anyone seemed in the mood for celebratory fireworks.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='339' data-total-count='659' itemprop='articleBody'>The conflict, which played out in increasingly contentious forums as the year progressed, left wounds too deep for that. Amazon has been cast as a bully in publications across the ideological spectrum, and a large group of authors is calling for it to be investigated on antitrust grounds. <a title='Related NY Times coverage.' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/technology/amazon-loss-quarterly-earnings.html'>Its sales were hit</a> by the dispute, analysts said.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='42' data-total-count='701' itemprop='articleBody'>Hachette, too, revealed its vulnerability.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='213' data-total-count='914' itemprop='articleBody'>Amazon’s supporters publicly questioned the need for Hachette, the fourth largest publisher, to exist in an era when authors can publish themselves digitally, an accusation Hachette was reluctant to respond to.</p> <aside class='marginalia related-coverage-marginalia nocontent robots-nocontent' data-marginalia-type='sprinkled' role='complementary'><!-- close nocontent --> </aside><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='231' data-total-count='1145' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-2'>And even if Amazon got less in the deal than it originally wanted, it still controls nearly half the book trade, an unprecedented level for one retailer.

Depending on where you stood, it was a struggle between the future and the past, the East Coast and the West Coast, culture and commerce, the masses and the elite, technologists and traditionalists, predator and prey.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='254' data-total-count='2336' itemprop='articleBody'>James Patterson was a forceful voice against Amazon during the dispute. “Books and publishing need to be preserved if not protected in this country,” said Mr. Patterson, a best-selling Hachette novelist. “For the moment, this deal helps do that.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='463' data-total-count='2799' itemprop='articleBody'>The multiyear agreement, which includes both e-books and print books, broadly follows a deal Amazon recently worked out with Simon &amp; Schuster. A source with knowledge of that deal said it was negotiated relatively quickly and gave the publisher control over most of its pricing but offered incentives to sell at lower prices. Amazon got increased co-op funds, the payments for placement on the retailer’s website. Simon &amp; Schuster declined to confirm the terms.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='131' data-total-count='2930' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-3'>James L. McQuivey, a Forrester analyst, said that if Hachette won in the short term, it would be a different story in the long run.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='394' data-total-count='3324' itemprop='articleBody'>“Hachette got Amazon to allow them to control pricing while also cutting the amount of money Amazon takes if the publisher does engage in discounts, which appears like a victory,” the analyst said. “But in the end this all cements Amazon’s ultimate long-term role in this business, which will only put Hachette right back in this situation every time they are up for renegotiation.” </p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='86' data-total-count='3410' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-4'>Neither side gave many details of the deal, but both pronounced themselves satisfied.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='171' data-total-count='3581' itemprop='articleBody'>An Amazon executive, David Naggar, said Amazon was “pleased with this new agreement as it includes specific financial incentives for Hachette to deliver lower prices.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='336' data-total-count='3917' itemprop='articleBody'>Amazon feels publishers get too much of the revenue from e-books, so that was another major area of contention. In a letter Thursday to authors and agents, Michael Pietsch, Hachette’s chief executive, said the percentage of revenue on which Hachette authors’ e-book royalties are based “will not decrease under this agreement.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='41' data-total-count='3958' itemprop='articleBody'>The change for consumers might be slight.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='288' data-total-count='4246' itemprop='articleBody'>“What does this mean for the publishing world? Not much,” J. A. Konrath, a fierce critic of traditional publishing houses, <a title='His blog.' href='http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/'>wrote on his blog</a>. The big New York publishers, he added, “are no doubt going to continue to price e-books as high as they can to protect their paper sales.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='306' data-total-count='4552' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-5'>The deal will bring relief to Hachette’s bottom line. United States sales for the Hachette Book Group were down 18.5 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago, its parent company, Lagardère, <a title='The company&#x2019;s Q3 results (PDF).' href='http://www.lagardere.com/fichiers/fckeditor/File/Relations_investisseurs/Resultats_financiers/resultats_&amp;'>reported on Thursday</a>. One reason cited by the company was “the difficult situation with Amazon.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='287' data-total-count='4839' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-6'>When Amazon raised the stakes in late spring by discouraging sales of Hachette books, that <a title='Related NY Times article.' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/08/business/media/plot-thickens-as-900-writers-battle-amazon.html'>incited the ire</a> of the publisher’s authors and eventually other members of the literary community. Among Amazon’s tactics was preventing advance sales, and causing weekslong shipping delays.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='187' data-total-count='5026' itemprop='articleBody'>Douglas Preston, a thriller writer published by Hachette, formed Authors United, a group with about 1,500 members, including some of the most prominent and popular writers in the country.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='229' data-total-count='5255' itemprop='articleBody'>“I’m relieved that Amazon and Hachette reached an agreement,” Mr. Preston said. But he added: “If anyone thinks this is over, they are deluding themselves. Amazon covets market share the way Napoleon coveted territory.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='234' data-total-count='5489' itemprop='articleBody'>Authors United and the Authors Guild, which has 9,000 members, are in the midst of writing a lengthy letter to the Justice Department urging an investigation of Amazon on antitrust grounds. Mr. Preston said that effort would continue.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='39' data-total-count='5528' itemprop='articleBody'>Hachette writers had varying responses.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='134' data-total-count='5662' itemprop='articleBody'>“Thank God,” Dave Cullen, the author of “Columbine,” wrote on Twitter. “But #EvilAmazon still a menace. Continue boycott.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='267' data-total-count='5929' itemprop='articleBody'>Meryl Gordon, author of “The Phantom of Fifth Avenue,” said she was “delighted and relieved.” She added: “I hope that Amazon has learned that books are not commodities like dishwasher detergent.  I’m looking forward to buying books again on my Kindle.”</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='272' data-total-count='6201' itemprop='articleBody'>At least some Hachette books still showed shipping delays as of Thursday night. Several popular Malcolm Gladwell titles all showed delays of one to three weeks. Mr. Preston and Lincoln Child’s thriller “The Lost Island” was described as taking as long as four weeks.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='350' data-total-count='6551' itemprop='articleBody' id='story-continues-7'>Mr. Preston, who proved quite a thorn in Amazon’s side, said the retailer and publisher were at odds until the last minute. He wrote in an email that his new novel with Mr. Child, “Blue Labyrinth,” was released this week but that some buyers found it impossible to download the e-book version on Amazon. Buyers lashed out with one-star reviews.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='152' data-total-count='6703' itemprop='articleBody'>“When customers complained Amazon sent them a note saying it was Hachette’s fault,” Mr. Preston wrote. Other Hachette books had similar troubles.</p><p class='story-body-text story-content' data-para-count='134' data-total-count='6837' itemprop='articleBody'>Was this a digital hiccup, or a final reminder by Amazon of its power?

Wayt Gibbs", pub_date: "13 Nov 2014", link_identifier: "http://feeds.wired.com/c/35185/f/661370/s/40765c9e/sc/4/l/0L0Swired0N0C20A140C110Cplan0Emap0Eillegal0Efishing0Espace0C/story01.htm", main_img_url: "http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/skytruth-gfw-world_pacific-1920x1080-660x371.jpg", content: "<div><span itemprop='articleBody' readability='64'><p/> <p>Illicit fishing goes on every day at an industrial scale. But large commercial fishers are about to get a new set of overseers: conservationists—and soon the general public—armed with space-based reconnaissance of the global fleet.</p> <p>Crews on big fishing boats deploy an impressive arsenal of technology—from advanced sonars to GPS navigation and mapping systems—as they chase down prey and trawl the seabed. These tools are so effective that roughly a third of the world’s fisheries are now overharvested, and more than three-quarters of the stocks that remain have hit their sustainable limits, <a href='http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3822e.pdf'>according to the FAO</a>. For some species, most of the catch is unreported, unregulated, or flat-out illegal.</p> <p/>But now environmentalists are using sophisticated technology of their own to peel away that cloak of invisibility. With satellite data from <a href='http://www.spacequest.com/' target='_blank'>SpaceQuest</a> and financial and engineering support from Google, two environmental activist groups have built the first global surveillance system that can track large fishing vessels anywhere in the world. <p>A prototype of the system, called <a href='http://globalfishingwatch.org'>Global Fishing Watch</a>, was unveiled today at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney. The tool makes use of Google’s mapping software and servers to display the tracks followed in 2012 and 2013 by some 25,000 ships that were either registered as large commercial fishers or were moving in ways that strongly suggest fishing activity.</p> <p>The project was led by <a href='http://oceana.org/en' target='_blank'>Oceana</a>, a marine conservation advocacy group, and the software was developed by <a href='http://skytruth.org/' target='_blank'>SkyTruth</a>, a small non-profit that specializes in using remote sensing technologies to map environmentally sensitive activities such as <a href='http://blog.skytruth.org/2014/10/PA-drilling-impoundments-2005-2013.html'>fracking </a>and <a href='http://skytruth.org/mapping-global-flaring/'>flaring from oil and gas fields</a>. Although the system currently displays voyages from nearly a year ago, “the plan is that we will build out a public release version that will have near-real-time data,” said Jackie Savitz, Oceana’s VP for U.S. oceans. “Then you’ll actually be able to see someone out there fishing within hours to days,” fast enough to act on the information if the fishing is happening illegally, such as in a marine protected area.</p> <p>The effort got its start at a conference in February, when Savitz sat down with Paul Woods of SkyTruth and Brian Sullivan of <a href='http://www.google.com/earth/outreach/index.html' target='_blank'>Google’s Ocean and Earth Outreach program</a>, and the three discovered they had all been thinking along the same lines: that the pieces were in hand to put eyes on the global fishing fleet, or at least the bigger boats out there. SpaceQuest now has four satellites in orbit that continually pick up radio transmissions that large ships send out as part of their automatic identification system (AIS), broadcasts that include a unique ID number and the vessel’s current position, speed, and heading. Each packet of data is relatively small, but the total AIS data stream is massive because it captures all kinds of boats: naval warships, supertankers, barges, even some yachts. To AIS a boat is a boat; there’s no easy way to tell which ones are fishing.</p> <p>So the group turned to Analyze Corp., where data scientists teamed up with a former NOAA agent who worked for many years as an official fishery observer to develop a heuristic algorithm that synthesizes input such as rapid changes in trajectory, distances covered over the past 24 hours, long-term movements and port visits over months, and the self-declared identity and class of the boat. “It combines all that and spits out a weighted classification—essentially a probability that this vessel is fishing at this particular spot and time,” Woods said.</p> <p>The filter isn’t perfect, but it winnows the data significantly. From a 1-terabyte starting set of 3.7 billion AIS messages intercepted from 111,000 vessels, the system extracted 300 million data points on about 25,000 boats that looked like they were fishing.</p> <p>“We were able to independently verify 3,125 of those as fishing vessels,” Woods said. He notes that the system does pick up some non-fishing activity as false positives.</p> <p>Arguably more important are the false negatives. Global Fishing Watch still misses most of the activity of the so-called dark fleet: smaller fishing boats that aren’t required to use AIS, and rogue fishers who turn their radios off before they enter restricted zones.</p> <p>“That is an issue, but the cool thing is the model can detect erratic AIS transmissions,” Savitz said. “If we see pings from a vessel every hour for a month, then it goes silent, but suddenly comes back on weeks later, we can pick that up and possibly trigger enforcement against them for not transmitting as they are supposed to.”</p> <p>Perhaps equally important, “we think this could be a tool for positive reinforcement to reward good fishing behavior,” said Brian Sullivan, a program manager with Google’s Ocean and Earth Outreach program. “If people can pay a premium for responsibly harvested fish with confidence in the supply chain, that aligns the economic incentives in a powerful way.”</p> <p>The next step is to open up use of the tool to everyone and plug it into a live stream of satellite data, so that ship tracks are current to within a few days. “The product really is not very far away from being a public platform,” Woods said. “Everything works in a web browser and on Google servers in the cloud. We could launch something publicly in a couple months if we secure funding to pay for the data feed.”</p> <p>In the meantime, Oceana has begun using the tool internally to track vessels that have already been blacklisted for fishing illegally, Savitz said. “We can see vessels that appear to be fishing in protected marine areas. Government officials often know about this activity but don’t do anything about it. We’ll use the tool to shine light on this activity and produce public pressure for officials to actually do their jobs.”</p></span></div><br><br><center><a href='http://www.wizardrss.com'>Powered By WizardRSS.com</a> | <a href='http://www.wizardrss.com'>Full Text RSS Feed</a> | <a href='http://wpzonbuilder.com'>Amazon Wordpress</a> | <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Credit-Card-Rfid-Blocking-Wallet-Sleeves/dp/B00IXR4TR2/'>rfid blocking wallet sleeves</a></center>"
